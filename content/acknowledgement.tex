Even after eight years at university, it still feels \emph{surprising} to see myself writing this PhD thesis and reaching this stage in my life. As a child, I looked up at the planets and the stars and I saw a universe of wonder. But as a teenager, I looked around me (here on the Earth) and I felt different, outcast, and fundamentally undeserving of the future I have managed to have. This thesis is for every LGBTQ+ child who grew up thinking the world is not for them. % TODO: LINK TO NEXT BIT?

I will forever be eternally indebted and grateful to the many, many people without whom I would never be here. % TODO: EXPLAIN WHY CHRONOLOGICAL

Dr. Michelle Cuthbert, your phenomenal commitment and passion for teaching had an impact on me that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I still remember my first lesson of Year 12 physics, where you asked those of us intending to study physics at university to raise our hands. I think one or two hands were raised, of which I was not one. You proudly remarked that you would change our minds in just eight months. By the end of Year 13, a majority of our class went on to study physics, in no small part thanks to your teaching. This thesis would never have happened had I never been exposed to your infectiously passionate physics teaching.

I next thank those I know from the University of Bath where I did my undergraduate degree. Dr. Vicky Scowcroft, the summer project I did with you and your % TODO
