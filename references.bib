TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, generalpurpose GPUs, and custom-designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous ``parameter server'' designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.},

We, then, move beyond the Local Group to review star cluster populations at various evolutionary stages, and in diverse galactic environmental conditions accessible in the local Universe. At high redshift, where conditions for cluster formation and evolution are more extreme, we are only able to observe the integrated light of a handful of objects that we believe will become globular clusters. We therefore discuss how numerical and analytical methods, informed by the observed properties of cluster populations in the local Universe, are used to develop sophisticated simulations potentially capable of disentangling the genetic map of galaxy formation and assembly that is carried by globular cluster populations.},

In this paper, we present, ML-MOC, a new machine learning based approach to identify likely members of open clusters using the Gaia DR2 data, and no a priori information about the clusters. We use the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm and the Gaussian Mixture Model on the high-precision proper motions and parallax measurements from Gaia DR2 data to determine the membership probabilities of individual sources down to G \textasciitilde 20 mag. To validate the developed method, we apply it on thirteen open clusters: M67, NGC 2099, NGC 2141, NGC 2243, NGC 2539, NGC 6253, NGC 6405, NGC 6791, NGC 7044, NGC 7142, NGC 752, Berkeley 18, and IC 4651. These clusters differ in terms of their ages, distances, metallicities, extinctions and cover a wide parameter space in proper motions and parallaxes with respect to the field population. The extracted members produce clean colour-magnitude diagrams and our astrometric parameters of the clusters are in good agreement with the values derived by the previous works. The degree of contamination in the extracted members range between 2\% and 12\%. The results show that ML-MOC is a reliable and scalable approach to segregate the open cluster members from the field stars.},

  abstract = {Westerlund 1 (Wd1) is potentially the largest star cluster in the Galaxy. That designation critically depends upon the distance to the cluster, yet the cluster is highly obscured, making luminosity-based distance estimates difficult. Using \{\textbackslash it Gaia\} Data Release 2 (DR2) parallaxes and Bayesian inference, we infer a parallax of \$0.35\^\{+0.07\}\_\{-0.06\}\$ mas corresponding to a distance of \$2.6\^\{+0.6\}\_\{-0.4\}\$ kpc. To leverage the combined statistics of all stars in the direction of Wd1, we derive the Bayesian model for a cluster of stars hidden among Galactic field stars; this model includes the parallax zero point. Previous estimates for the distance to Wd1 ranged from 1.0 to 5.5 kpc, although values around 5 kpc have usually been adopted. The \{\textbackslash it Gaia\} DR2 parallaxes reduce the uncertainty from a factor of 3 to 18\textbackslash\% and rules out the most often quoted value of 5 kpc with 99\textbackslash\% confidence. This new distance allows for more accurate mass and age determinations for the stars in Wd1. For example, the previously inferred initial mass at the main-sequence turn-off was around 40 M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$; the new \{\textbackslash it Gaia\} DR2 distance shifts this down to about 22 M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. This has important implications for our understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution, including the initial mass of the magnetar and the LBV in Wd1. Similarly, the new distance suggests that the total cluster mass is about four times lower than previously calculated.},

  abstract = {Previous studies of open clusters have shown that lithium depletion is not only strongly age dependent but also shows a complex pattern with other parameters that is not yet understood. For pre- and main-sequence late-type stars, these parameters include metallicity, mixing mechanisms, convection structure, rotation, and magnetic activity. We perform a thorough membership analysis for a large number of stars observed within the Gaia-ESO survey (GES) in the field of 20 open clusters, ranging in age from young clusters and associations, to intermediate-age and old open clusters. Based on the parameters derived from the GES spectroscopic observations, we obtained lists of candidate members for each of the clusters in the sample by deriving RV distributions and studying the position of the kinematic selections in the EW(Li) versus Teff plane to obtain lithium members. We used gravity indicators to discard field contaminants and studied [Fe/H] metallicity to further confirm the membership of the candidates. We also made use of studies using recent data from the Gaia DR1 and DR2 releases to assess our member selections. We identified likely member candidates for the sample of 20 clusters observed in GES (iDR4) with UVES and GIRAFFE, and conducted a comparative study that allowed us to characterize the properties of these members, as well as identify field contaminant stars, both lithium-rich giants and non-giant outliers. This work is the first step towards the calibration of the lithium-age relation and its dependence on other GES parameters. During this project we aim to use this relation to infer the ages of GES field stars, and identify their potential membership to young associations and stellar kinematic groups of different ages.},

  abstract = {Recent advances from astronomical surveys have revealed spatial, chemical, and kinematical inhomogeneities in the inner region of the stellar halo of the Milky Way Galaxy. In particular, large spectroscopic surveys, combined with Gaia astrometric data, have provided powerful tools for analyzing the detailed abundances and accurate kinematics for individual stars. Despite these noteworthy efforts, however, spectroscopic samples are typically limited by the numbers of stars considered; their analysis and interpretation are also hampered by the complex selection functions that are often employed. Consequently, piecewise information on individual components must be stitched together in order to reconstruct the multi-dimensional structure of the Milky Way's stellar populations. Here we present a powerful alternative approach - a synoptic view of the spatial, chemical, and kinematical distributions of stars in the Milky Way based on large photometric survey databases, enabled by a well-calibrated technique for obtaining individual stellar metal abundances from broad-band photometry. We combine metallicities with accurate proper motions from the Gaia mission along the Prime Meridian of the Galaxy, and find that various stellar components are clearly separated from each other in the metallicity versus rotation-velocity space. The observed metallicity distribution of the inner-halo stars deviates from the traditional single-peaked distribution, and exhibits complex substructures comprising varying contributions from individual stellar populations, sometimes with striking double peaks at low metallicities. The substructures revealed from our maps demonstrate the clear advantages of this approach, which can be built upon by future mixed-band and broad-band photometric surveys, and used as a blueprint for identifying the stars of greatest interest for upcoming spectroscopic studies.},

Using a catalogue of homogeneously determined ages for 834 open clusters contained in a 2 kpc cylinder around the Sun and characterised with astrometric and photometric data from the Gaia satellite, we find that it is necessary to revise earlier works that relied on data from the Milky Way Star Cluster survey. After establishing age-dependent completeness limits for our sample, we find that the cluster age function in the range \$6.5 {$<$} \textbackslash log t{$<$}10\$ is compatible with a Schechter-type or broken power-law function, whose parameters we determine by MCMC fitting. Our best-fit values indicate an earlier drop of the age function (by a factor of \$2-3\$) with respect to the results obtained in the last five years, and are instead more compatible with results obtained in the early 2000s and radio observations of inner-disc clusters. Furthermore, we find excellent agreement with the dynamical cluster formation and destruction models of Lamers et al. (2005), indicating a typical destruction time-scale of \$\textbackslash sim1.5\$ Gyr for a \$10\^4\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ cluster and a present-day cluster-formation rate of \$\textbackslash sim 0.6\textbackslash pm 0.1\$ Myr\$\^\{-1\}\$kpc\$\^\{-2\}\$, suggesting that only \$8-15\textbackslash, \textbackslash\%\$ of all stars born in the solar neighbourhood form in bound clusters.

We employed parameters associated to the OCs dynamical evolution: core (\$r\_c\$), tidal (\$r\_t\$) and half-mass (\$r\_\{hm\}\$) radii, age and crossing time (\$t\_\{cr\}\$). Relations among these parameters were exploited to draw some evolutionary connections. We also included 11 OCs with previous characterizations to provide wider coverage of the parameters space. The investigated sample spans a considerable range in age (log (t/yr) \textasciitilde 7.0 - 9.7) and Galactocentric distance (\$R\_G\$ \textasciitilde{} 6 - 11 kpc). Most of them present solar metallicity. We employed GAIA DR2 astrometry and photometry and selected member stars through a decontamination algorithm which explores the 3D astrometric space (\$\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash alpha\}\$, \$\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash delta\}\$, \$\textbackslash varpi\$) to assign membership likelihoods. Previous studies of most of these objects were based mostly on photometric information. All investigated OCs were proved to be real stellar concentrations and relations among their parameters indicate a general disruption scenario in which OCs tend to be more concentrated as they evolve. Internal interactions sucessively drive OCs to develop more dynamically relaxed structures and make them less subject to mass loss due to tidal effects. Tidal radius tends to increase with \$R\_G\$ in accordance with the strength of the Galactic tidal field. Besides, the correlation between the \$r\_c\$ and the dynamical ratio \$\textbackslash tau\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{dyn\}\}\$ = age/\$t\_\{cr\}\$ suggests two distinct evolutionary sequences, which may be consequence of different initial formation conditions.},

  abstract = {In this work, we investigate the dynamical properties of 38 Galactic open clusters: 34 of them are located at low Galactic latitudes (|b| {$<$} 10\$\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$) and are projected against dense stellar fields; the other 4 comparison objects present clearer contrasts with the field population. We determine structural and time-related parameters that are associated with the clusters' dynamical evolution: core (\$r\_c\$), tidal (\$r\_t\$) and half-mass (\$r\_\{hm\}\$) radii, ages (\$t\$) and crossing times (\$t\_\{cr\}\$). We have also incorporated results for 27 previously studied clusters, creating a sample of 65, spanning the age and Galactocentric distance (\$R\_G\$) ranges: 7.0 {$<$} log (\$t\$) {$<$} 9.7 and 6 {$<$} \$R\_G\$ (kpc) {$<$} 13. We employ a uniform analysis method which incorporates photometric and astrometric data from the Gaia DR2 catalogue. Member stars are identified by employing a decontamination algorithm which operates on the 3D astrometric space of parallax and proper motion and attributes membership likelihoods for stars in the cluster region. Our results show that the internal relaxation causes \$r\_c\$ to correlate negatively with the dynamical ratio \$\textbackslash tau\_\{dyn\}\$ = \$t/t\_\{cr\}\$. This implies that dynamically older systems tend to be more centrally concentrated. The more concentrated ones tend to present smaller \$r\_\{hm\}/r\_t\$ ratios, which means that they are less subject to tidal disruption. The analysis of coeval groups at compatible \$R\_G\$ suggests that the inner structure of clusters is reasonably insensitive to variations in the external tidal field. Additionally, our results confirm, on average, an increase in \$r\_t\$ for regions with less intense Galactic gravitational field.},

  abstract = {Most stars in our Galaxy form in stellar aggregates, which can become long-lived structures called open clusters (OCs). Along their dynamical evolution, their gradual depletion leave some imprints on their structure. In this work, we employed astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic data from the \textbackslash textit\{Gaia\} DR3 catalogue to uniformly characterize a sample of 60 OCs. Structural parameters (tidal, core and half-light radii, respectively, \$r\_t\$, \$r\_c\$ and \$r\_h\$), age, mass (\$M\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{clu\}\}\$), distance, reddening, besides Jacobi radius (\$R\_J\$) and half-light relaxation time (\$t\_\{rh\}\$), are derived from radial density profiles and astrometrically decontaminated colour-magnitude diagrams. Ages and Galactocentric distances (\$R\_G\$) range from 7.2\$\textbackslash,\textbackslash lesssim\textbackslash,\$log(\$t.\$yr\$\^\{-1\}\$)\$\textbackslash,\textbackslash lesssim\textbackslash,\$9.8 and 6\$\textbackslash,\textbackslash lesssim\textbackslash,R\_G\$(kpc)\$\textbackslash,\textbackslash lesssim\textbackslash,\$12. Analytical expressions derived from \$N\$-body simulations, taken from the literature, are also employed to estimate the OC initial mass (\$M\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{ini\}\}\$) and mass loss due to exclusively dynamical effects. Both \$r\_c\$ and the tidal filling ratio, \$r\_h/R\_J\$, tend to decrease with the dynamical age (=\$t/t\_\{rh\}\$), indicating the shrinking of the OCs' internal structure as consequence of internal dynamical relaxation. This dependence seems differentially affected by the external tidal field, since OCs at smaller \$R\_G\$ tend to be dynamically older and have smaller \$M\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{clu\}\}/M\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{ini\}\}\$ ratios. In this sense, for \$R\_G\textbackslash lesssim8\textbackslash,\$kpc, the \$r\_h/R\_J\$ ratio presents a slight positive correlation with \$R\_G\$. Beyond this limit, there is a dichotomy in which more massive OCs tend to be more compact and therefore less subject to tidal stripping in comparison to those less massive and looser OCs at similar \$R\_G\$. Besides, the \$r\_t/R\_J\$ ratio also tends to correlate positively with \$R\_G\$.},

  abstract = {A number of stellar open cluster (OC) pairs in the Milky Way occupy similar positions in the phase space (coordinates, parallax and proper motions) and therefore may constitute physically interacting systems. The characterization of such objects based on observational data is a fundamental step towards a proper understanding of their physical status and to investigate cluster pair formation in the Galaxy. In this work, we employed Gaia EDR3 data to investigate a set of 16 OCs distributed as seven stellar aggregates. We determined structural parameters and applied a decontamination technique that allowed to obtain unambiguous lists of member stars. The studied OCs span Galactocentric distances and ages in the ranges \textasciitilde 7 {$<$} \$R\_G\$ (kpc) {$<$} \textasciitilde 11 and 7.3 {$<$}= log t {$<$}= 9.2. Eight OCs were found to constitute 4 gravitationally bound pairs (NGC5617-Trumpler22, Collinder394-NGC6716, Ruprecht100-Ruprecht101, NGC659-NGC663, the latter being a dynamically unevolved binary) and other 4 clusters constitute 2 interacting, but gravitationally unbound, pairs (King16-Berkeley4, NGC2383-NGC2384, the latter being a dissolving OC). Other 4 OCs (Dias1, Pismis19, Czernik20, NGC1857) seem not associated to any stellar aggregates. Apparently, clusters within bound and dynamically evolved pairs tend to present ratios of half-light to tidal radius larger than single clusters located at similar \$R\_G\$, suggesting that mutual tidal interactions may possibly affect their structural parameters. Unbound or dynamically unevolved systems seems to present less noticeable signature of tidal forces on their structure. Moreover, the core radius seems more importantly correlated with the clusters' internal dynamical relaxation process.},

  abstract = {Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-data sets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to the density-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only `traditional' clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT. The GOSSS spectral classifications and Gaia data have significantly improved our ability to measure distances and determine memberships of stellar groups with OB stars. AIMS. We have started a program to identify, measure distances, and determine the membership of Galactic stellar groups with OB stars. We start with the identification and distance determinations of groups with O stars. In this paper we concentrate on groups that contain stars with the earliest spectral subtypes. METHODS. We use GOSSS to select Galactic stellar groups with O2-O3.5 stars and a method that combines Gaia DR2 photometry, positions, proper motions, and parallaxes to assign robust memberships and measure distances. We also include the two clusters in that paper to generate our first list of 16 O-type Galactic stellar groups. RESULTS. We derive distances, determine the membership, and analyze the structure of sixteen Galactic stellar groups with O stars, Villafranca O-001 to O-016, including the 14 groups with the earliest-O-type optically-accessible stars known in the Milky Way. We compare our distance with previous results and establish that the best consistency is with VLBI parallaxes and the worst is with kinematic distances. Our results indicate that massive stars can form in relatively low-mass clusters or even in near-isolation, as is the case for the Bajamar star in the North America nebula. This lends support to the hierarchical scenario of star formation, where some stars are born in well-defined bound clusters but others are born in associations that are unbound from the beginning: groups of newborn stars come in many shapes and sizes. We propose that HD 64 568 and HD 64 315 AB could have been ejected simultaneously from Villafranca O-012 S. Our results are consistent with a difference of approx. 20 microas in the Gaia DR2 parallax zero point between bright and faint stars. (ABRIDGED)},

The mock SSPs cover an age range of 6.8 \${$<\$$} log (age/yr) \${$<\$$} 10.2, for three wavelength ranges in the optical regime, using both Padova and MIST isochrone models. Random noise is added to the model spectra to achieve S/N ratios between 10 to 100 per wavelength pixel. We find that for S/N \$\textbackslash geq\$ 50, this technique can yield ages of SSPs to an overall precision of \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash,\textbackslash mbox\{log(age/yr)\} \textbackslash sim 0.1\$ for ages in the ranges 7.0 \$\textbackslash leq\$ log (age/yr) \$\textbackslash leq\$ 8.3 and 8.9 \$\textbackslash leq\$ log (age/yr) \$\textbackslash leq\$ 9.4.

The precision of age and metallicity estimation using this method depends significantly on the S/N and the wavelength range used in the fitting. We quantify the systematic differences in age predicted by the MIST and Padova isochrone models, due to their different assumptions about stellar physics in various important (i.e., luminous) phases of stellar evolution, which needs to be taken in consideration when comparing ages of star clusters obtained using these popular models. Knowing the strengths and limitations of this technique is crucial in interpreting the results obtained for real star clusters and for deciding the optimal instrument setup before performing the observations.},

A correct inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability distribution. Here, we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the physical properties of, or interstellar extinction toward, individual stars. We analyze the characteristics of the catalog and validate it using clusters.

  abstract = {Stellar distances constitute a foundational pillar of astrophysics. The publication of 1.47 billion stellar parallaxes from Gaia is a major contribution to this. Yet despite Gaia's precision, the majority of these stars are so distant or faint that their fractional parallax uncertainties are large, thereby precluding a simple inversion of parallax to provide a distance. Here we take a probabilistic approach to estimating stellar distances that uses a prior constructed from a three-dimensional model of our Galaxy. This model includes interstellar extinction and Gaia's variable magnitude limit. We infer two types of distance. The first, geometric, uses the parallax together with a direction-dependent prior on distance. The second, photogeometric, additionally uses the colour and apparent magnitude of a star, by exploiting the fact that stars of a given colour have a restricted range of probable absolute magnitudes (plus extinction). Tests on simulated data and external validations show that the photogeometric estimates generally have higher accuracy and precision for stars with poor parallaxes. We provide a catalogue of 1.47 billion geometric and 1.35 billion photogeometric distances together with asymmetric uncertainty measures. Our estimates are quantiles of a posterior probability distribution, so they transform invariably and can therefore also be used directly in the distance modulus (5log10(r)-5). The catalogue may be downloaded or queried using ADQL at various sites (see http://www.mpia.de/homes/calj/gedr3\_distances.html) where it can also be cross-matched with the Gaia catalogue.},

In an area occupied by a cluster, the frequency function is made up of two contributions: cluster and field stars. The tool performs an empirical determination of the frequency functions from the vector point diagram without relying on any previous assumption about their profiles. Clusterix 2.0 allows us to search the appropriate spatial areas in an interactive way until an optimal separation of the two populations is obtained. Several parameters can be adjusted to make the calculation computationally feasible without interfering with the quality of the results.

  abstract = {More and more observations indicate that young star clusters could retain imprints of their formation process. In particular, the degree of substructuring and rotation are possibly the direct result of the collapse of the parent molecular cloud from which these systems form. Such properties can, in principle, be washed-out, but they are also expected to have an impact on the relaxation of these systems. We ran and analyzed a set of ten hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of embedded star clusters through the collapse of turbulent massive molecular clouds. We systematically studied the fractality of our star clusters, showing that they are all extremely substructured (fractal dimension \$D=1.0-1.8\$). We also found that fractality is slowly reduced, with time, on small scales, while it persists on large scales on longer timescales. Signatures of rotation are found in different simulations at every time of the evolution, even for slightly supervirial substructures, proving that the parent molecular gas transfers part of its angular momentum to the new stellar systems.},

  abstract = {Context. The classic question of how young massive star clusters attain the shapes and sizes, as we find them today, is still a difficult one. Both observational and computational studies of star-forming massive molecular gas clouds suggest that massive cluster formation is primarily triggered along the small-scale ({$\lessequivlnt$}0.3 pc) filamentary substructures within the clouds. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: The present study investigates the possible ways in which a filament-like, compact, massive star cluster (effective radius 0.1-0.3 pc) can expand more than 10 times, still remaining massive enough ({$\greaterequivlnt$} 10\textsuperscript{4}M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}) to become the young massive star cluster that we observe today. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: To this end, model massive clusters (initially 10\textsuperscript{4}-10\textsuperscript{5}M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}) are evolved using Sverre Aarseth's state-of-the-art N-body code NBODY7. Apart from the accurate calculation of two-body relaxation of the constituent stars, these evolutionary models take into account stellar-evolutionary mass loss and dynamical energy injection due to massive, tight primordial binaries and stellar-remnant black holes and neutron stars. These calculations also include a solar-neighbourhood-like external tidal field. All the computed clusters expand with time, and their sizes (effective radii) are compared with those observed for young massive clusters ({$\lessequivlnt$} 100 Myr) in the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: In this study, it is found that beginning from the above compact sizes, a star cluster cannot expand on its own, I.e., due to two-body relaxation, stellar mass loss, and dynamical heating by primordial binaries and compact stars up to the observed sizes of young massive clusters; star clusters always remain much more compact than the observed ones. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: This calls for additional mechanisms that boost the expansion of a massive cluster after its assembly. Using further N-body calculations, it is shown that a substantial residual gas expulsion with {$\approx$} 30\% star formation efficiency can indeed swell the newborn embedded cluster adequately. The limitations of the present calculations and their consequences are discussed.},

  abstract = {I study the potential role of young massive (YMCs) and open star clusters (OCs) in assembling stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) which would be detectable as persistent gravitational-wave (GW) sources by the forthcoming LISA mission. The energetic dynamical interactions inside star clusters make them factories of assembling BBHs and other types of double-compact binaries that undergo general-relativistic (GR) inspiral and merger. The initial phase of such inspirals would, typically, sweep through the LISA GW band. Here, such LISA sources are studied from a set of evolutionary models of star clusters with masses ranging over \$10\^4M\_\textbackslash odot-10\^5M\_\textbackslash odot\$ that represent YMCs and intermediate-aged OCs in metal-rich and metal-poor environments of the Local Universe. These models are evolved with long-term, direct, relativistic many-body computations incorporating state-of-the-art stellar-evolutionary and remnant-formation models. Based on models of Local Universe constructed with such model clusters, it is shown that YMCs and intermediate-aged OCs would yield several 10s to 100s of LISA BBH sources at the current cosmic epoch with GW frequency within \$10\^\{-3\}\{\textbackslash rm\textasciitilde Hz\} - 10\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm\textasciitilde Hz\}\$ and signal-to-noise-ratio (S/N) \${$>$}5\$, assuming a mission lifetime of 5 or 10 years. Such LISA BBHs would have a bimodal distribution in total mass, be generally eccentric (\$\textbackslash lesssim0.7\$), and typically have similar component masses although mass-asymmetric systems are possible. Intrinsically, there would be 1000s of present-day, LISA-detectable BBHs from YMCs and OCs. That way, YMCs and OCs would provide a significant and the dominant contribution to the stellar-mass BBH population detectable by LISA. A small fraction, \${$<$}5\$\%, of these BBHs would undergo GR inspiral to make it to LIGO-Virgo GW frequency band and merge, within the mission timespan; \${$<$}15\$\% would do so within twice the timespan.},

  abstract = {Context. Open clusters are recognised as excellent tracers of Galactic thin-disc properties. At variance with intermediate-age and old open clusters, for which a significant number of studies is now available, clusters younger than {$\lessequivlnt$}150 Myr have been mostly overlooked in terms of their chemical composition until recently (with few exceptions). On the other hand, previous investigations seem to indicate an anomalous behaviour of young clusters, which includes (but is not limited to) slightly sub-solar iron (Fe) abundances and extreme, unexpectedly high barium (Ba) enhancements. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: In a series of papers, we plan to expand our understanding of this topic and investigate whether these chemical peculiarities are instead related to abundance analysis techniques. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We present a new determination of the atmospheric parameters for 23 dwarf stars observed by the Gaia-ESO survey in five young open clusters ({$\tau$} \&lt; 150 Myr) and one star-forming region (NGC 2264). We exploit a new method based on titanium (Ti) lines to derive the spectroscopic surface gravity, and most importantly, the microturbulence parameter. A combination of Ti and Fe lines is used to obtain effective temperatures. We also infer the abundances of Fe I, Fe II, Ti I, Ti II, Na I, Mg I, Al I, Si I, Ca I, Cr I, and Ni I. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: Our findings are in fair agreement with Gaia-ESO iDR5 results for effective temperatures and surface gravities, but suggest that for very young stars, the microturbulence parameter is over-estimated when Fe lines are employed. This affects the derived chemical composition and causes the metal content of very young clusters to be under-estimated. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: Our clusters display a metallicity [Fe/H] between +0.04 {$\pm$} 0.01 and +0.12 {$\pm$} 0.02; they are not more metal poor than the Sun. Although based on a relatively small sample size, our explorative study suggests that we may not need to call for ad hoc explanations to reconcile the chemical composition of young open clusters with Galactic chemical evolution models. {$<$}P /{$>$}Full Table 2 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{$<$}/A{$>$} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/634/A34"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/634/A34{$<$}/A{$>$} {$<$}P /{$>$}Based on observations collected with the FLAMES instrument at VLT/UT2 telescope (Paranal Observatory, ESO, Chile), for the Gaia- ESO Large Public Spectroscopic Survey (188.B-3002, 193.B-0936).},

We find a strong correlation of the global mass function slopes of star clusters with both their internal relaxation times as well as their lifetimes. Once dynamical effects are being accounted for, the mass functions of most star clusters are compatible with an initial mass function described by a broken power-law distribution \$N(m) \textbackslash sim m\^\textbackslash alpha\$ with break masses at 0.4 M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ and 1.0 M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ and mass function slopes of \$\textbackslash alpha\_\{Low\}=-0.3\$ for stars with masses \$m{$<$}0.4\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$, \$\textbackslash alpha\_\{High\}=-2.30\$ for stars with \$m{$>$}1.0\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$\textbackslash alpha\_\{Med\}=-1.65\$ for intermediate-mass stars. Alternatively, a log-normal mass function with a characteristic mass \$\textbackslash log M\_C = -0.36\$ and width \$\textbackslash sigma\_C=0.28\$ for low-mass stars and a power-law mass function for stars with \$m{$>$}1\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ also fits our data. We do not find a significant environmental dependency of the initial mass function with either cluster mass, density, global velocity dispersion or metallicity. Our results lead to a larger fraction of high-mass stars in globular clusters compared to canonical Kroupa/Chabrier mass functions, increasing the efficiency of self-enrichment in clusters and helping to alleviate the mass budget problem of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters. By comparing our results with direct N-body simulations we finally find that only simulations in which most black holes are ejected by natal birth kicks correctly reproduce the observed correlations.},

We use Gaia DR2 data over an area of 40 deg radius around the open cluster Collinder 135 to extend the study of the stellar populations of the Vela OB2 region over an area of several hundreds of parsecs on sky. Detailed clustering algorithms combined with the exquisite astrometric quality of the Gaia catalogue allow us to detect a new cluster named BBJ 1 that shows the same age as NGC 2547 (30 to 35 Myr), but located at a distance of 260 pc from it. Deeper investigation of the region via clustering in 5D parameter space and in the colour-magnitude diagram allows us to detect a filamentary structure of stars that bridges the two clusters. Given the extent in space of such structure (260 pc) and the young age ({$\sim$}35 Myr), we exclude that such population originates by the same mechanism responsible to create tidal streams around older clusters. Even if we miss a complete picture of the 3D motion of the studied stellar structure because of the lack of accurate radial velocity measurements, we propose that such structure represents the detection of a 35-Myr-old outcome of a mechanism of filamentary star formation in a GMC.},

Furthermore, the complex nature of the problem, its appeal for citizen scientists and the large data rates generated by existing and upcoming radio telescopes combine to make the morphological classification of radio sources an ideal test case for the application of machine learning techniques. One approach that has shown great promise recently is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Literature, however, lacks two major things when it comes to CNNs and radio galaxy morphological classification. Firstly, a proper analysis of whether overfitting occurs when training CNNs to perform radio galaxy morphological classification using a small curated training set is needed. Secondly, a good comparative study regarding the practical applicability of the CNN architectures in literature is required. Both of these shortcomings are addressed in this paper. Multiple performance metrics are used for the latter comparative study, such as inference time, model complexity, computational complexity and mean per class accuracy. As part of this study we also investigate the effect that receptive field, stride length and coverage has on recognition performance. For the sake of completeness, we also investigate the recognition performance gains that we can obtain by employing classification ensembles. A ranking system based upon recognition and computational performance is proposed. MCRGNet, Radio Galaxy Zoo and ConvXpress (novel classifier) are the architectures that best balance computational requirements with recognition performance.},

  abstract = {By studying the normalized cumulative radial distribution (nCRD) of the stars in the central region of a Monte Carlo-simulated globular cluster, we recently defined three parameters able to pinpoint the stage of internal dynamical evolution reached by the system: \$A\_5\$ (i.e., the area subtended by the nCRD within 5\$\textbackslash\%\$ the half-mass radius, \$r\_h\$), \$P\_5\$ (the value of the nCRD at 5\$\textbackslash\%\$ \$r\_h\$), and \$S\_\{2.5\}\$ (the slope of the nCRD at 2.5\$\textbackslash\%\$ \$r\_h\$). Here we extend the analysis and explore the effects that different fractions (0\$\textbackslash\%\$, 10\$\textbackslash\%\$, and 20\$\textbackslash\%\$) of primordial binaries and stellar-mass black holes (BHs) induce on the dynamical history of the system. As expected, the gradual contraction of the cluster becomes milder and core collapse shallower for increasing binary fraction. Nevertheless, the cluster dynamical evolution is still properly traced by the three parameters. For models with a larger initial retention of stellar mass BHs the evolution depends on the timescale of their subsequent dynamical ejection. An early dynamical ejection of BHs results in a long-term evolution of the three parameters similar to that found in systems with no initial BH retention. Conversely, in the model that retains a large number of BHs for extended time (slow dynamical ejection of BHs), the system is characterized by a less concentrated structure and by the lack of significant temporal evolution of the three parameters. The smaller values of the three parameters found in this case might be used to indirectly infer the possible presence of BHs in the cluster.},

We identify the member stars of these clusters from the precise astrometric and deep photometric data from \$Gaia\$ Early Data Release 3 using the robust membership determination algorithm, ML-MOC. We identify 46 open clusters having a stellar corona beyond the tidal radius, 20 of which exhibit extended tails aligned with the cluster orbit direction in galactocentric coordinates. Notably we find NGC 6940 (at a distance of \$\textbackslash sim1\$ kpc) is the furthest open cluster exhibiting tidal tails that are \$\textbackslash sim50\$ pc from its center, while also identifying \$\textbackslash sim40\$ pc long tidal tails for the nearby Pleiades. Using the minimum spanning tree length for the most massive stars relative to all cluster members, we obtain the mass segregation ratio (\$\textbackslash rm\textbackslash lambda\_\{MSR\}\$) profiles as a function of the number of massive stars in each cluster. From these profiles, we can classify the open clusters into four classes based on the degree of mass segregation experienced by the clusters. We find that clusters in the most mass segregated classes are the oldest on average and have the flattest mass function slope. Of the 46 open clusters studied in this work, 41 exhibit some degree of mass segregation. Furthermore, we estimate the initial masses (M\$\textbackslash rm\_\{i\}\$) of these open clusters finding that some of them, having M\$\textbackslash rm\_\{i\}\textbackslash gtrsim 10\^\{4\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, could be the dissolving remnants of Young Massive Clusters.},

  abstract = {Context. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the go-to method for fast object detection and classification on natural images. This opens the door for astrophysical parameter inference on the exponentially increasing amount of sky survey data. Until now, star cluster analysis was based on integral or resolved stellar photometry, which limits the amount of information that can be extracted from individual pixels of cluster images. Aims. We aim to create a CNN capable of inferring star cluster evolutionary, structural, and environmental parameters from multi-band images, as well to demonstrate its capabilities in discriminating genuine clusters from galactic stellar backgrounds. Methods. A CNN based on the deep residual network (ResNet) architecture was created and trained to infer cluster ages, masses, sizes, and extinctions, with respect to the degeneracies between them. Mock clusters placed on M83 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images utilizing three photometric passbands (F336W, F438W, and F814W) were used. The CNN is also capable of predicting the likelihood of a cluster's presence in an image, as well as quantifying its visibility (signal-to-noise). Results. The CNN was tested on mock images of artificial clusters and has demonstrated reliable inference results for clusters of ages \$\textbackslash lesssim\$100 Myr, extinctions \$A\_V\$ between 0 and 3 mag, masses between \$3\textbackslash times10\^3\$ and \$3\textbackslash times10\^5\$ \$\{\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$, and sizes between 0.04 and 0.4 arcsec at the distance of the M83 galaxy. Real M83 galaxy cluster parameter inference tests were performed with objects taken from previous studies and have demonstrated consistent results.},

For this we use a convolutional neural network trained on mock clusters and capable of fast identification and localization of star clusters, as well as inference of their parameters from multi-band images. We use this pipeline to detect 3,380 cluster candidates in Hubble Space Telescope observations. The sample of cluster candidates shows an age gradient across the galaxy's spiral arms, which is in good agreement with predictions of the density wave theory and other studies. As measured from the dust lanes of the spiral arms, the younger population of cluster candidates peaks at the distance of \$\textbackslash sim\$0.4 kpc while the older candidates are more dispersed, but shifted towards \$\textbackslash gtrsim\$0.7 kpc in the leading part of the spiral arms. We find high extinction cluster candidates positioned in the trailing part of the spiral arms, close to the dust lanes. We also find a large number of dense older clusters near the center of the galaxy and a slight increase of the typical cluster size further from the center.},

In addition to the rich subsequent literature for the previous classes, we now also include HI shells and supershells. A total of 9305 objects were cross-identified, while our previous catalogues amounted to 7900 entries, an increase of \textasciitilde 12 per cent. We present the results in subcatalogues containing 1445 emission nebulae, 3740 star clusters, 3326 associations and 794 HI shells and supershells. Angular and apparent size distributions of the extended objects are analysed. We conclude that the objects, in general, appear to respond to tidal effects arising from the LMC, SMC and Bridge. Number-density profiles extracted along directions parallel and perpendicular to the LMC bar, can be described by two exponential-discs. A single exponential-disc fits the equivalent SMC profiles. Interestingly, when angular-averaged number-densities of most of the extended objects are considered, the profiles of both Clouds do not follow an exponential-disc. Rather, they are best described by a tidally truncated, core/halo profile, despite the fact that the Clouds are clearly disturbed discs. On the other hand, the older star clusters taken isolately, distribute as an exponential disc. The present catalogue is an important tool for the unambiguous identification of previous objects in current CCD surveys and to establish new findings.},

This multi-band catalog was constructed over 20 years, starting with visual inspections on the Digital Sky Survey and incremented with the 2MASS, WISE, VVV, Spitzer, and Herschel surveys. Large and small catalogs, as well as papers on individual objects have been systematically cross-identified. The catalog provides Galactic and equatorial coordinates, angular diameters, and chronologically ordered designations, making it simple to assign discoveries and verify how often the objects were cataloged by different authors, search methods, and/or surveys. Detection in a single band is the minimum constraint to validate an entry. About 3200 objects have measured parameters in the literature. A fundamental contribution of the present study is to present an additional {$\approx$}7700 objects for the first analyses of nature, photometry, spectroscopy and structure. The present focus is not to compile or determine fundamental parameters, but to provide a catalog uniformly characterizing the entries. A major result is that now 4234 embedded clusters are cataloged, a factor of {$\approx$}1.5 larger than open clusters. In addition to cross-identifications in different references and wavelength domains, we also communicate the discovery of 638 star clusters and similar objects. The present general catalog provides previously studied objects and thousands of additional entries in a homogeneous way, a timely contribution to Gaia-related works.},

In particular, we cross-identified recent cluster samples from the VMC, OGLE-IV and SMASH surveys, confirming new clusters and pointing out equivalencies. A major contribution of the present catalog consists in the accurate central positions for clusters and small associations, including a new sample of 45 clusters or candidates in the SMC and 19 in the Bridge, as well as a compilation of the most reliable age and metallicity values from the literature. A general catalog must also deal with the recent discoveries of 27 faint and ultra-faint star clusters and galaxies projected on the far surroundings of the Clouds, most of them from the DES survey. The information on these objects has been complemented with photometric, spectroscopic and kinematical follow-up data from the literature. The underluminous galaxies around the Magellanic System, still very few as compared to the predictions from \$\textbackslash Lambda\$ Cold Dark Matter simulations, can bring constraints to galaxy formation and hierarchical evolution. Furthermore, we provide diagnostics, when possible, of the nature of the ultra-faint clusters, searching for borders of the Magellanic System extensions into the Milky Way gravitational potential.},

Thanks to metallicity measurements obtained from both ESA Gaia and high-resolution spectroscopy, we argue that the origin of this dichotomy is likely related to the chemical composition: stars whose magnetic cycle frequency increases with rotation rate are less metallic than stars whose magnetic cycle frequency decreases with stellar rotation rates. On the contrary, no clear difference in chromospheric magnetic activity indicators characterizes the two branches.},

Because of the different GC sizes (characterised by the half-light radius \$R\_h\$) and distances to the Sun, the WFC/ACS field of view (\$200\textbackslash arcsec\textbackslash times200\textbackslash arcsec\$) coverage (\$R\_\{obs\}\$) lies in the range \$1\textbackslash la R\_\{obs\}/R\_h\textbackslash la15\$ for about 85\% of the sample, with about 10\% covering only the inner (\$R\_\{obs\}\textbackslash la R\_h\$) parts. We divide the WFC/ACS field of view across each cluster in a regular cell grid, and extract the stellar-density Hess diagram from each cell, shifting it in colour and magnitude along the reddening vector until matching the mean diagram. Thus, the maps correspond to the internal dispersion of the reddening around the mean. Depending on the number of available stars (i.e. probable members with adequate photometric errors), the angular resolution of the maps range from \$\textbackslash approx7\textbackslash arcsec\textbackslash times7\textbackslash arcsec\$ to \$\textbackslash approx20\textbackslash arcsec\textbackslash times20\textbackslash arcsec\$. We detect spatially-variable extinction in the 66 globular clusters studied, with mean values ranging from \$\textbackslash mEBV\textbackslash approx0.018\$ (NGC\textbackslash,6981) up to \$\textbackslash mEBV\textbackslash approx0.16\$ (Palomar\textbackslash,2). Differential-reddening correction decreases the observed foreground reddening and the apparent distance modulus but, since they are related to the same value of \textbackslash EBV, the distance to the Sun is conserved. Fits to the mean-ridge lines of the highly-extincted and photometrically scattered globular cluster Palomar\textbackslash,2 show that age and metallicity also remain unchanged after the differential-reddening correction, but measurement uncertainties decrease because of the reduced scatter. The lack of systematic variations of \textbackslash mEBV\textbackslash{} with both the foreground reddening and the sampled cluster area indicates that the main source of differential reddening is interstellar.},

In contrast, clusters formed in turbulence-dominated environments exhibit an \{\textbackslash it inverse\} mass segregated velocity dispersion, where massive stars exhibit larger velocity dispersions than low-mass cores, consistent with massive stars formed in massive clumps, which in turn, are formed through strong shocks. We furthermore use Gaia EDR3 to show that the stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster exhibit a constant velocity dispersion as a function of mass, suggesting that it has been formed by collapse within one free-fall time of its parental cloud, rather than in a turbulence-dominated environment during many free-fall times of a supported cloud. Additionally, we have addressed several of the criticisms of models of collapsing star forming regions: namely, the age spread of the ONC, the comparison of the ages of the stars to the free-fall time of the gas that formed it, the star formation efficiency, and the mass densities of clouds vs the mass densities of stellar clusters, showing that observational and numerical data are consistent with clusters forming in clouds undergoing a process of global, hierarchical and chaotic collapse, rather than been supported by turbulence.},

Whenever possible the Gaia DR2 parameters are used to calculate the mean proper motions, radial velocities, reddening and distances. We report the discovery of 120 new infrared clusters and stellar groups. Approximately half of them (47 per cent) are faint, compact, highly reddened, and they seem to be associated with other indicators of recent star formation, such as nearby Young Stellar Objects, Masers, H II regions or bubbles. The preliminary distance determinations allow us to trace the clusters up to 4.5 kpc, but most of the cluster candidates are centred at 2.2 kpc. The mean proper motions of the clusters show that in general they follow the disc motion of the Galaxy.},

We improve the completeness of the embedded cluster population in this region, adding small size (linear diameters of 0.2-1.4 pc) and relatively far objects (heliocentric distance between 2 and 4 kpc) to existing catalogues. Nine candidates are proposed to be older open cluster candidates. Three of them (VVVX CL204, 207, 208) have sufficient numbers of well-resolved stellar members to allow us to determine some basic cluster parameters. We confirm their nature as older, low-mass open clusters. Photometric analysis of 15 known clusters shows that they have ages above 20Myr, and masses below 2000Msun: in general, their proper motions follow the motion of the disk. We outline some groups of clusters, most probably formed within the same dust complex. Broadly, our candidates follow the network of filamentary structure in the remaining dust. Thus, in this part of the southern disk of the Galaxy, we have found recent star formation, producing small size and young clusters, in addition to the well known, massive young clusters, including NGC3603, Westerlund2 and the Carina Nebula Complex.},

The answer to this question will be crucial for any astronomer attempting to map the Milky Way with Gaia DR2. We infer the completeness of Gaia DR2 by exploiting the fact that it only contains sources with at least five astrometric detections. The odds that a source achieves those five detections depends on both the number of observations and the probability that an observation of that source results in a detection. We predict the number of times that each source was observed by Gaia and assume that the probability of detection is either a function of magnitude or a distribution as a function of magnitude. We fit both these models to the 1.7 billion stars of Gaia DR2, and thus are able to robustly predict the completeness of Gaia across the sky as a function of magnitude. We extend our selection function to account for crowding in dense regions of the sky, and show that this is vitally important, particularly in the Galactic bulge and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. We find that the magnitude limit at which Gaia is still 99\% complete varies over the sky from \$G=18.9\$ to \$21.3\$. We have created a new Python package selectionfunctions (https://github.com/gaiaverse/selectionfunctions) which provides easy access to our selection functions.},

We argue that the completeness is driven by Gaia's spinning-and-precessing scanning law and will apply this principle to the Gaia-verse over this series. We take a first step by identifying the periods in time that did not contribute any measurements to Gaia DR2; these gaps create ribbons of incompleteness across the sky that will bias any study that ignores them, although some of these gaps may be filled in future data releases. Our first approach was to use the variable star photometry to identify the 94 gaps longer than 1\% of a day. Our second approach was to predict the number of observations of every point on the sky, which in comparison to the reported number of detections revealed additional gaps in the astrometry and spectroscopy. Making these predictions required us to make the most precise, publicly-available determination of the Gaia scanning law. Using this scanning law, we further identified that most stars fainter than \$G=22\$ in DR2 have spurious magnitudes due to a miscalibration resulting from a thunderstorm over Madrid. Our list of gaps and precision scanning law will allow astronomers to know when Gaia's eye was truly on their binary star, exoplanet or microlensing event during the time period of the second data release.},

  abstract = {We generalize the well-known mixtures of Gaussians approach to density  estimation and the accompanying Expectation-Maximization technique for finding the maximum likelihood parameters of the mixture to the case where each data point carries an individual d-dimensional uncertainty covariance and has unique missing data properties. This algorithm reconstructs the error-deconvolved or "underlying" distribution function common to all samples, even when the individual data points are samples from different distributions, obtained by convolving the underlying distribution with the heteroskedastic uncertainty distribution of the data point and projecting out the missing data directions. We show how this basic algorithm can be extended with conjugate priors on all of the model parameters and a "split-and-merge" procedure designed to avoid local maxima of the likelihood. We demonstrate the full method by applying it to the problem of inferring the three-dimensional velocity distribution of stars near the Sun from noisy two-dimensional, transverse velocity measurements from the Hipparcos satellite.},

  abstract = {Context. The origin and dynamical evolution of star clusters is an important topic in stellar astrophysics. Several models have been proposed in order to understand the formation of bound and unbound clusters and their evolution, and they can be tested by examining the kinematical and dynamical properties of clusters over a wide range of ages and masses. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We use the Gaia-ESO Survey products to study four open clusters (IC 2602, IC 2391, IC 4665, and NGC 2547) that lie in the age range between 20 and 50 Myr. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We employ the gravity index {$\gamma$} and the equivalent width of the lithium line at 6708 \AA{} together with effective temperature T\textsubscript{eff} and the metallicity of the stars in order to discard observed contaminant stars. Then we derive the cluster radial velocity dispersions {$\sigma$}\textsubscript{c}, the total cluster mass M\textsubscript{tot}, and the half mass radius r\textsubscript{hm}. Using the Gaia-DR1 TGAS catalogue, we independently derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the clusters from the astrometric parameters of cluster members. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: The intrinsic radial velocity dispersions derived by the spectroscopic data are higher than those derived from the TGAS data, possibly due to the different masses of the considered stars. Using M\textsubscript{tot} and r\textsubscript{hm} we derive the virial velocity dispersion {$\sigma$}\textsubscript{vir} and we find that three out of four clusters are supervirial. This result is in agreement with the hypothesis that these clusters are dispersing, as predicted by the "residual gas expulsion" scenario. However, recent simulations show that the virial ratio of young star clustersmay be overestimated if it is determined using the global velocity dispersion, since the clusters are not fully relaxed.},

It is the result of a thorough revision of the major input physics, together with the inclusion of the pre-main sequence phase, not present in our previous releases of stellar models. Another innovative aspect is the possibility of promptly generating accurate opacity tables fully consistent with any selected initial chemical composition, by coupling the Opacity Project At Livermore (OPAL) data at high temperatures to the molecular opacities computed with our \ae SOPUS code. In this work, we present extended sets of stellar evolutionary models for various initial chemical compositions, while other sets with different metallicities and/or different distributions of heavy elements are being computed. For the present release of models, we adopt the solar distribution of heavy elements from the recent revision by Caffau et al., corresponding to a Sun's metallicity Z {$\simeq$} 0.0152. From all computed sets of stellar tracks, we also derive isochrones in several photometric systems. The aim is to provide the community with the basic tools to model star clusters and galaxies by means of population synthesis techniques.},

We do not find evidence for multiple discrete modes of star formation (e.g. clustered and distributed). Comparing the observed surface density distribution to previously reported surface density threshold definitions of clusters, we find that the fraction of stars in clusters is crucially dependent on the adopted definitions, ranging from 40 to 90 per cent. However, we find that only a low fraction ({$<$}26 per cent) of stars are formed in dense environments where their formation/evolution (along with their circumstellar discs and/or planets) may be affected by the close proximity of their low-mass neighbours.},

  abstract = {Classical Cepheids provide the foundation for the empirical extragalactic distance ladder. Milky Way Cepheids are the only stars in this class accessible to trigonometric parallax measurements. However, the parallaxes of Cepheids from the second Gaia data release (GDR2) are affected by systematics because of the absence of chromaticity correction, and occasionally by saturation. As a proxy for the parallaxes of 36 Galactic Cepheids, we adopt either the GDR2 parallaxes of their spatially resolved companions or the GDR2 parallax of their host open cluster. This novel approach allows us to bypass the systematics on the GDR2 Cepheids parallaxes that is induced by saturation and variability. We adopt a GDR2 parallax zero-point (ZP) of -0.046 mas with an uncertainty of 0.015 mas that covers most of the recent estimates. We present new Galactic calibrations of the Leavitt law in the V, J, H, K\_S , and Wesenheit W\_H bands. We compare our results with previous calibrations based on non-Gaia measurements and compute a revised value for the Hubble constant anchored to Milky Way Cepheids. From an initial Hubble constant of 76.18 +/- 2.37 km/s/Mpc based on parallax measurements without Gaia, we derive a revised value by adopting companion and average cluster parallaxes in place of direct Cepheid parallaxes, and we find H\_0 = 72.8 +/- 1.9 (statistical + systematics) +/- 1.9 (ZP) km/s/Mpc when all Cepheids are considered and H0 = 73.0 +/- 1.9 (statistical + systematics) +/- 1.9 (ZP) km/s/Mpc for fundamental mode pulsators only.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} We present the second \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} data release, \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} A summary of the contents of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 results.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The raw data collected with the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. \emph{Results. Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{BP{$<$}sub/{$>$} (330\textendash 680 nm) and \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RP{$<$}sub/{$>$} (630\textendash 1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$}-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. \emph{Conclusions. Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 represents a major achievement for the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

We perform a differential analysis with the goal of understanding how each of the updates affects star cluster populations. Two key parameters are the momentum boost of supernova feedback \$f\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{boost\}\}\$ and star formation efficiency per freefall time \$\textbackslash epsilon\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ff\}\}\$. We find that \$f\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{boost\}\}\$ has a strong influence on the galactic star formation rate, with higher values leading to less star formation. The efficiency \$\textbackslash epsilon\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ff\}\}\$ does not have a significant impact on the global star formation rate, but dramatically changes cluster properties, with increasing \$\textbackslash epsilon\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ff\}\}\$ leading to a higher maximum cluster mass, shorter age spread of stars within clusters, and higher integrated star formation efficiencies. We also explore the redshift evolution of the observable cluster mass function, finding that most massive clusters have formed at high redshift \$z{$>$}4\$. Extrapolation of cluster disruption to \$z=0\$ produces good agreement with both the Galactic globular cluster mass function and age-metallicity relation. Our results emphasize the importance of using small-scale properties of galaxies to calibrate subgrid models of star cluster formation and feedback.},

  abstract = {We exploit a combination of high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope and wide-field ESO-VLT observations to study the slope of the global mass function (alphaG) and its radial variation (alpha(r)) in the two dense, massive and post core-collapse globular clusters M15 and M30. The available data-set samples the clusters' Main Sequence down to 0.2 Msun and the photometric completeness allows the study of the mass function between 0.40 Msun and 0.75 Msun from the central regions out to their tidal radii. We find that both clusters show a very similar variation in alpha(r) as a function of clustercentric distance. They both exhibit a very steep variation in alpha(r) in the central regions, which then attains almost constant values in the outskirts. Such a behavior can be interpreted as the result of long-term dynamical evolution of the systems driven by mass-segregation and mass-loss processes. We compare these results with a set of direct N-body simulations and find that they are only able to reproduce the observed values of alpha(r) and alphaG at dynamical ages (t/trh) significantly larger than those derived from the observed properties of both clusters. We investigate possible physical mechanisms responsible for such a discrepancy and argue that both clusters might be born with a non-standard (flatter/bottom-lighter) initial mass function.},

NGC 1605 presents an unusual morphology with a sparse stellar distribution and a double core in close angular proximity. The 2MASS and Gaia-EDR3 field-star decontaminated colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) show two distinct stellar populations located at the same heliocentric distance of \$\textbackslash sim2.6\$ kpc suggesting that there are two clusters in the region, NGC 1605a and NGC 1605b, with ages of \$2\$ Gyr and \$600\$ Myr, respectively. Both Gaia parallax and PM distributions are compact and very similar indicating that they are open clusters (OCs) and share the same kinematics. The large age difference, 1.4 Gyr, points to a formation by tidal capture during a close encounter and the close spatial proximity and similar kinematics suggest an ongoing merger event. There are some prominent tidal debris that appear to trace the clusters' orbits during the close encounter and, unexpectedly, some of them appear to be bound structures, which may suggest that additionaly to the evaporation the merging clusters are being broken apart into smaller structures by the combination of Galactic disk, Perseus arm, and mutual tidal interactions. In this sense, the newly found binary cluster may be a key object on the observational validation of theoretical studies on binary cluster pairs formation by tidal capture as well as in the formation of massive clusters by merging, and tidal disruption of stellar systems.},

Population proportions arise frequently as quantities of interest in astronomical research; for instance, in studies aiming to constrain the bar fraction, active galactic nucleus fraction, supermassive black hole fraction, merger fraction, or red sequence fraction from counts of galaxies exhibiting distinct morphological features or stellar populations. However, two of the most widely-used techniques for estimating binomial confidence intervals - the `normal approximation' and the Clopper \& Pearson approach - are liable to misrepresent the degree of statistical uncertainty present under sampling conditions routinely encountered in astronomical surveys, leading to an ineffective use of the experimental data (and, worse, an inefficient use of the resources expended in obtaining that data). Hence, I provide here an overview of the fundamentals of binomial statistics with two principal aims: (i) to reveal the ease with which (Bayesian) binomial confidence intervals with more satisfactory behaviour may be estimated from the quantiles of the beta distribution using modern mathematical software packages (e.g. r, matlab, mathematica, idl, python); and (ii) to demonstrate convincingly the major flaws of both the `normal approximation' and the Clopper \& Pearson approach for error estimation.},

We employ a sample of binary stars and a sample of open cluster members to characterize this proper motion bias as a magnitude-dependent spin of the reference frame. We show that the bias varies with G magnitude, reaching up to 80 \{\textbackslash mu\}as/yr for sources in the range G = 11 - 13, several times the formal EDR3 proper motion uncertainties. We also show evidence for an additional dependence on the color of the source, with a magnitude up to 10 \{\textbackslash mu\}as/yr. However, a color correction proportional to the effective wavenumber is unsatisfactory for very red or very blue stars and we do not recommend its use. We provide a recipe for a magnitude-dependent correction to align the proper motion of the Gaia EDR3 sources brighter than G=13 with the International Celestial Reference Frame.},

  abstract = {Context. Many of the open clusters listed in modern catalogues were initially reported by visual astronomers as apparent overdensities of bright stars. As observational techniques and analysis methods continue to improve, some of them have been shown to be chance alignments of stars and not true clusters. Recent publications making use of Gaia DR2 data have provided membership lists for over a thousand clusters, however, many nearby objects listed in the literature have so far evaded detection. Aims: We aim to update the Gaia DR2 cluster census by performing membership determinations for known clusters that had been missed by previous studies and for recently-discovered clusters. We investigate a sub-set of non-detected clusters that, according to their literature parameters, should be easily visible in Gaia. Confirming or disproving the existence of old, inner-disc, high-altitude clusters is especially important as their survival or disruption is linked to the dynamical processes that drive the evolution of the Milky Way. Methods: We employed the Gaia DR2 catalogue and a membership assignment procedure, as well as visual inspections of spatial, proper motion, and parallax distributions. We used membership lists provided by other authors when available. Results: We derived membership lists for 150 objects, including ten that were already known prior to Gaia. We compiled a final list of members for 1481 clusters. Among the objects that we are still unable to identify with the Gaia data, we argue that many (mostly putatively old, relatively nearby, high-altitude objects) are not true clusters. Conclusions: At present, the only confirmed cluster located further than 500 pc away from the Galactic plane within the Solar circle is NGC 6791. It is likely that the objects discussed in this study only represent a fraction of the non-physical groupings erroneously listed in the catalogues as genuine open clusters and that those lists need further cleaning.

For this purpose, we need to know their chemical composition in detail. Unfortunately, the number of systems with chemical abundances determined from high resolution spectroscopy remains small. Aims: Our aim is to increase the number of open clusters with radial velocities and chemical abundances determined from high resolution spectroscopy by sampling a few stars in clusters not studied previously. Methods: We obtained high resolution spectra with the FIES spectrograph at NOT for 41 stars belonging to 20 open clusters. These stars have high astrometric membership probabilities, determined from the Gaia second data release. Results: We derived radial velocities for all the observed stars, which were used to confirm their membership to the corresponding clusters. For Gulliver\textbackslash,37 we cannot be sure the observed star is a real member. We derived atmospheric parameters for the 32 stars considered real cluster members. We discarded five stars because they have very low gravity or atmospheric parameters were not properly constrained due to low signal-to-noise ratio spectra. Therefore, detailed chemical abundances were determined for 28 stars belonging to 17 clusters. For most of them, this is the first chemical analysis available in the literature. Finally, we compared the clusters in our sample to a large population of well studied clusters. The studied systems follow the trends, both chemical and kinematical, described by the majority of open clusters. Worth noticing that the three most metal-poor studied clusters (NGC\textbackslash,1027, NGC\textbackslash,1750 and Trumpler 2) are enhanced in Si but not in the other alpha-elements studied (Mg, Ca and Ti).},

None of the cluster pairs of the group seems to be an authentic binary cluster, with the possible exception of the candidate pair Teutsch 8/FSR 198. Instead, NGC 6871 seems to be disintegrating, and the primordial group members appear to be dispersing out rapidly. Searching for new open clusters in the vicinity of young or grouped OCs using Gaia data is an efficient strategy to find new associated OCs forming primordial groups.},

  abstract = {The physical nature of a series of 20 new open clusters is confirmed employing existing data on putative star members, mainly from second Gaia Data Release (DR2). The clusters were discovered as overdensities of stars by visual inspection of either photographic DSS plates or proper motion plots of random source fields. The reported objects are not present in the most comprehensive or recent catalogs of stellar clusters and associations. For all of them, clumps of comoving stars are revealed in the proper motion space. The parallaxes of the clumped stars are compatible with the real existence of open clusters over narrow ranges of distances. Surface density calculations, free of most noise from non-member sources, allow in some cases differentiating a cluster core and an extended cluster corona. Color-magnitude diagrams generally show a definite main sequence that allows the confirmation of the physical existence of the clusters and some of their characteristics. Two of the new clusters seem to form a double system with a common origin. Several of the new clusters challenge the claim of near completeness of the known OC population in the distance range from 1.0 to 1.8 kpc of the Sun (Kharchenko et al. 2013).},

  abstract = {The large amount of data available for analysis and management raises the need for defining, determining, and extracting meaningful information from the data. Hence in scientific, engineering, and economics studies, the practice of clustering data arises naturally when sets of data have to be divided into subgroups with the aim of possibly deducting common features for data belonging to the same subgroup. For instance, the innovation scoreboard [1] (see Figure 1) allows for the classification of the countries into four main clusters corresponding to the level of innovation defining the ``leaders,'' the ``followers,'' the ``trailing,'' and the ``catching up'' countries. Many other disciplines may require or take advantage of a clustering of data, from market research [2] to gene expression analysis [3], from biology to image processing [4][7]. Therefore, several clustering techniques have been developed (for details see ``Review of Clustering Algorithms'').},

We exploit the HARPS-N spectrograph at the TNG telescope to acquire high-resolution optical spectra for 15 member stars of four clusters. We derive stellar parameters using both the EW analysis and the spectral fitting technique. We compute elemental abundances for light, a-, iron-peak, and n-capture elements using the EW measurement approach. We investigate the origin of the correlation between metallicity and stellar parameters derived with the EW method for the coolest stars of the sample (Teff {$<$} 4300 K). The correlation is likely due to the challenging continuum setting and to a general inaccuracy of model atmospheres used to reproduce the conditions of very cool giant stars. We locate the properties of our clusters in the radial distributions of metallicity and abundance ratios, comparing our results with clusters from the Gaia-ESO and APOGEE surveys. We present the [X/Fe]-[Fe/H] and [X/Fe]-Rgc trends for elements in common between the two surveys and derive the C and Li abundances as a function of the evolutionary phase and compare them with theoretical models. The SPA survey allows us to fully characterise the chemistry of nearby clusters. With a single set of spectra, we provide chemical abundances for some chemical elements, which are comparable to those obtained in two of the largest surveys combined. The metallicities and abundance ratios of our clusters fit very well in the radial distributions defined by the recent literature, reinforcing the importance of star clusters to outline the spatial distribution of abundances in our Galaxy. Moreover, the abundances of C and Li agree with evolutionary prescriptions for their masses and metallicities.},

  abstract = {Context: Precise chemical abundances coupled with reliable ages are key ingredients to understand the chemical history of our Galaxy. Open Clusters (OCs) are useful for this purpose because they provide ages with good precision. Aims: The aim of this work is to investigate the relations of different chemical abundance ratios vs age traced by red clump (RC) stars in OCs. Methods: We analyze a large sample of 209 reliable members in 47 OCs with available high-resolution spectroscopy. We applied a differential line-by-line analysis to provide a comprehensive chemical study of 25 chemical species. This sample is among the largest samples of OCs homogeneously characterized in terms of atmospheric parameters, detailed chemistry, and ages. Results: In our metallicity range (-0.2{$<$}[M/H]{$<$}+0.2) we find that while most Fe-peak and alpha elements have flat dependence with age, the s-process elements show decreasing trends with increasing age with a remarkable knee at 1 Gyr. For Ba, Ce, Y, Mo and Zr we find a plateau at young ages ({$<$} 1 Gyr). We investigate the relations of all possible combinations among the computed chemical species with age. We find 19 combinations with significant slopes, including [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al]. The ratio [Ba/alpha] is the one with the most significant correlations found. Conclusions: We find that the [Y/Mg] relation found in the literature using Solar twins is compatible with the one found here in the Solar neighbourhood. The age-abundance relations show larger scatter for clusters at large distances (d{$>$}1 kpc) than for the Solar neighbourhood, particularly in the outer disk. We conclude that these relations need to be understood also in terms of the complexity of the chemical space introduced by the Galactic dynamics, on top of pure nucleosynthetic arguments, especially out of the local bubble.},

For that purpose their chemical composition needs to be known with a high level of confidence. The aims of this work are (1) to determine accurate and precise abundances of 22 chemical species (from Na to Eu) in the Hyades, Praesepe and Rupecht 147 using a large number of stars at different evolutionary states, (2) to evaluate the level of chemical homogeneity of these OCs, (3) to compare their chemical signatures. We gathered \$\textbackslash sim\$800 high resolution and high S/N spectra of \$\textbackslash sim\$100 members in the three OCs, obtained with the latest memberships based on Gaia DR2 data. We build a pipeline which computes atmospheric parameters and strictly line-by-line differential abundances among twin stars in our sample, which allows us to reach a very high precision in the abundances (0.01-0.02 dex in most of the elements). We find large differences in the absolute abundances in some elements, which can be attributed to diffusion, NLTE effects or systematics in the analysis. For the three OCs, we find strong correlations in the differential abundances between different pairs of elements, which can be explained by some level of chemical inhomogeneity. We compare differential abundances of several stars from the Hyades and Praesepe tails: the stars that differ more in chemical abundances also have distinct kinematics, even though they have been identified as members of the tail. With this technique we find that the Hyades and Preasepe have the same chemical signature when G dwarfs and K giants are considered. Despite a certain level of inhomogeneity in each cluster, it is still possible to clearly distinguish the chemical signature of the older cluster Ruprecht\textasciitilde 147 when compared to the others.},

  abstract = {The possibility of identifying co-natal stars that have dispersed into the Galactic disc based on chemistry only is called strong chemical tagging. Its feasibility has been debated for a long time, with the promise of reconstructing the detailed star-formation history of a large fraction of stars in the Galactic disc. We investigate the feasibility of strong chemical tagging using known member stars of open clusters. We analysed the largest sample of cluster members that have been homogeneously characterised with high-resolution differential abundances for 16 different elements. We also investigated the possibility of finding the known clusters in the APOGEE DR16 red clump sample with 18 chemical species. For both purposes, we used a clustering algorithm and an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique to blindly search for groups of stars in chemical space. Even if the internal coherence of the stellar abundances in the same cluster is high, typically 0.03 dex, the overlap in the chemical signatures of the clusters is large. In the sample with the highest precision and no field stars, we only recover 9 out of the 31 analysed clusters at a 40\% threshold of homogeneity and precision. This ratio slightly increases when we only use clusters with 7 or more members. In the APOGEE sample, field stars are present along with four populated clusters. In this case, only one of the open clusters was moderately recovered. In our best-case scenario, more than 70\% of the groups of stars are in fact statistical groups that contain stars belonging to different real clusters. This indicates that the chances of recovering the majority of birth clusters dissolved in the field are slim, even with the most advanced clustering techniques. We show that different stellar birth sites can have overlapping chemical signatures [abridged]},

Studies using open clusters favour the description of the Milky Way spiral arms as long-lived structures following the classical density wave theory. Current studies comparing the Gaia DR2 field stars kinematic information of the Solar neighbourhood to simulations, find a better agreement with short-lived arms with a transient behaviour. Aims. Our aim is to provide an observational, data-driven view of the Milky Way spiral structure and its dynamics using open clusters as the main tracers, and to contrast it with simulation-based approaches. We use the most complete catalogue of Milky Way open clusters, with astrometric Gaia EDR3 updated parameters, estimated astrophysical information and radial velocities, to re-visit the nature of the spiral pattern of the Galaxy. Methods. We use a Gaussian mixture model to detect overdensities of open clusters younger than 30 Myr that correspond to the Perseus, Local, Sagittarius and Scutum spiral arms, respectively. We use the birthplaces of the open cluster population younger than 80 Myr to trace the evolution of the different spiral arms and compute their pattern speed. We analyse the age distribution of the open clusters across the spiral arms to explore the differences in the rotational velocity of stars and spiral arms. Results. We are able to increase the range in Galactic azimuth where present-day spiral arms are described, better estimating its parameters by adding 264 young open clusters to the 84 high-mass star-forming regions used so far, thus increasing by a 314\% the number of tracers. We use the evolution of the open clusters from their birth positions to find that spiral arms nearly co-rotate with field stars at any given radius, discarding a common spiral pattern speed for the spiral arms explored.

  abstract = {We introduce Deep-CEE (Deep Learning for Galaxy Cluster Extraction and Evaluation), a proof of concept for a novel deep learning technique, applied directly to wide-field colour imaging to search for galaxy clusters, without the need for photometric catalogues. This technique is complementary to traditional methods and could also be used in combination with them to confirm galaxy cluster candidates. We use a state-of-the-art probabilistic algorithm, adapted to localize and classify galaxy clusters from other astronomical objects in SDSS imaging. As there is an abundance of labelled data for galaxy clusters from previous classifications in publicly available catalogues, we do not need to rely on simulated data. This means we keep our training data as realistic as possible, which is advantageous when training a deep learning algorithm. Ultimately, we will apply our model to surveys such as LSST and Euclid to probe wider and deeper into unexplored regions of the Universe. This will produce large samples of both high redshift and low mass clusters, which can be utilized to constrain both environment-driven galaxy evolution and cosmology.},

We use the code \{\textbackslash tt NBODY6\} to evolve a suite of star cluster models with an initial mass of \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(10\^4)\$M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ and varying initial parameters. We conclude that cluster metallicity plays the most significant role in determining the lifespan of a cluster, while the initial half-mass radius is dominant in setting the rate of BH exchange interactions in the central cluster regions. We find that the mass of interacting BHs, rather than how frequently their interactions with other BHs occur, is more crucial in the thermal expansion and eventual evaporation of the cluster. We formulate a novel approach to easily quantify the degree of BH-BH dynamical activity in each model. We report 12 in-cluster and three out-of-cluster (after ejection from the cluster) DBH mergers, of different types (inspiral, eccentric, hierarchical) across the ten \$N\$-body models presented. Our DBH merger efficiency is 3--4\$\textbackslash times10\^\{-5\}\$ mergers per M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$. We note the cluster initial density plays the most crucial role in determining the number of DBH mergers, with the potential presence of a transitional density point (between 1.2-3.8\$\textbackslash times10\^3\$M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$/pc\$\^3\$) below which the number of in-cluster mergers increases with cluster density and above which the increased stellar density acts to prevent in-cluster BH mergers. The importance of the history of dynamical interactions within the cluster in setting up the pathways to ejected DBH mergers is also discussed.},

High-precision \{\textbackslash sl Gaia\} early Data Release 3 astrometry, coupled with modern machine-learning methods, allows this to be done. We have compiled a well-defined sample which includes OB stars and young open clusters, in total comprising about 47,700 objects. To break the sample down into groupings resembling associations, we applied the HDBSCAN\$\^\{*\}\$ clustering algorithm. We used a Monte Carlo method to estimate the kinematic ages of the resulting clusters and the Student's \$t\$-test to assess the significance of the linear correlations between proper motions and coordinates, indicating the presence of possible cluster expansion signatures. The ages of the majority of clusters demonstrating a general expansion at a 1\$\textbackslash sigma\$ confidence level are several tens of Myr, which is in agreement with the expected ages of OB associations. We found 32 open clusters which turned out to be members of the resulting groupings; their ages are consistent with one another within the uncertainties. Comparison of the clusters thus obtained with the historical composition of OB associations in the literature shows a correspondence between their positions in the Galaxy but an apparent absence of good one-to-one stellar matches. Therefore, we suggest that the historical composition of OB associations needs to be revised.},

The algorithms represent two distinct approaches to limiting user bias when selecting parameter values and evaluating the relative weights among astrometric parameters. \textbackslash textit\{EnLink\} adopts a locally adaptive distance metric and eliminates the need of parameter tuning through automation. The original SNN relies only on human input for parameter tuning so we modified SNN to run in two stages. We first ran the original SNN 7,000 times, each with a randomly generated sample according to within-source co-variance matrices provided in \textbackslash textit\{Gaia\} DR2 and random parameter values within reasonable ranges. During the second stage, we modified SNN to identify the most repeating stellar groups from 25,798 we obtained in the first stage. We reveal 21 spatially- and kinematically-coherent groups in the Orion complex, 12 of which previously unknown. The groups show a wide distribution of distances extending as far as about 150 pc in front of the star-forming Orion molecular clouds, to about 50 pc beyond them where we find, unexpectedly, several groups. Our results expose to view the wealth of sub-structure in the OB association, within and beyond the classical Blaauw Orion OBI sub-groups. A full characterization of the new groups is of the essence as it offers the potential to unveil how star formation proceeds globally in large complexes such as Orion.

We constrain the intrinsic abundance scatter in 17 newly chemically-tagged dissolved birth clusters found in the APOGEE survey by modeling APOGEE spectra as a one-dimensional function of initial stellar mass, performing forward modeling of the observed stellar spectra, and comparing the data and simulations using Approximate Bayesian Computation. We test this method on the well-known open clusters M67, NGC 6819, NGC 7789, and NGC 6791. We study 15 elements in APOGEE and find that, in general, we are able to obtain very strong constraints on the intrinsic abundance scatter of most elements in the chemically-tagged birth clusters, with upper limits of {$<\sptilde$} 0.02 dex for C, {$<\sptilde$} 0.03 dex for O, Mn, and Fe, {$<\sptilde$} 0.04 dex for Si and Ni, and {$<\sptilde$} 0.05 dex for N, Mg, and Ca. While we find some evidence for a small amount of chemical inhomogeneity in the remaining elements (i.e. Na, Al, S, K, Ti, and V), we are still able to obtain stronger limits compared to those found for open clusters, consistent with previous findings. By strongly constraining the level of chemical homogeneity within reconstructed birth clusters, we can strengthen the statement that these groups of stars represent birth clusters, with promising implications for future chemical tagging studies.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the detailed results obtained in the search of  density-velocity inhomogeneities in a volume limited and absolute magnitude limited sample of A-F type dwarfs within 125 parsecs of the Sun. A 3-D wavelet analysis is used to extract inhomogeneities, both in the density and velocity distributions. Thus, a real picture of the phase space is produced. Not only are some clusters and streams detected, but the fraction of clumped stars can be measured. By estimating individual stellar ages one can relate the streams and clusters to the state of the interstellar medium (ISM) at star formation time and provide a quantitative view of cluster evaporation and stream mixing. Having established this picture without assumption we come back to previously known observational facts regarding clusters and associations, moving groups or so-called superclusters. In the 3-D position space, well known open clusters (Hyades, Coma Berenices and Ursa Major), associations (parts of the Scorpio-Centaurus association) as well as the Hyades evaporation track are retrieved. Three new probably loose clusters are identified (Bootes, Pegasus 1 and 2). The sample is relatively well mixed in the position space since less than 7 per cent of the stars belong to structures with coherent kinematics, most likely gravitationally bound. The wavelet analysis exhibits strong velocity structuring at typical scales of velocity dispersion /line{$\sigma\_$}stream \textasciitilde{} 6.3, 3.8 and 2.4 km s(-1) . The majority of large scale velocity structures (/line{$\sigma\_$}stream \textasciitilde{} 6.3 km s(-1) ) are Eggen's superclusters (Pleiades SCl, Hyades SCl and Sirius SCl) with the whole Centaurus association. A new supercluster-like structure is found with a mean velocity between the Sun and Sirius SCl velocities. These structures are all characterized by a large age range which reflects the overall sample age distribution. Moreover, a few old streams of \textasciitilde{} 2 Gyr are also extracted at this scale with high U components. We show that all these large velocity dispersion structures represent 63\% of the sample. This percentage drops to 46\% if we remove the velocity background created by a smooth velocity ellipsoid in each structure. Smaller scales (/line{$\sigma\_$}stream \textasciitilde{} 3.8 and 2.4 km s(-1) ) reveal that superclusters are always substructured by 2 or more streams which generally exhibit a coherent age distribution. At these scales, background stars are negligible and percentages of stars in streams are 38\% and 18\% respectively. Based on data from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite.},

Many previous studies have systematically searched for OCs near the solar system within 1.2 kpc or 20 degrees of galactic latitude. However, few studies searched for OCs at higher galactic latitudes and deeper distances. In this study, based on a hybrid unsupervised clustering algorithm (Friends-of-Friends and pyUPMASK) and a binary classification algorithm (Random Forest), we extended the search region (i.e., galactic latitude |b|{$>$}=20 degrees) and performed a fine-grained blind search of Galactic clusters in Gaia DR3. After cross-matching, the newly discovered cluster candidates are fitted using isochrone fitting to estimate the main physical parameters (age and metallicity) of these clusters. These cluster candidates were then checked using manual visual inspection. Their statistical properties were compared with previously exposed cluster catalogs as well. In the end, we found 1,179 new clusters with considerable confidence within 5kpc.},

  abstract = {Young stellar clusters across nearly five orders of magnitude in mass appear to follow a simple mass-radius relationship (MRR), \$R\_\{\textbackslash star\} \textbackslash propto M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\^\{\textbackslash alpha\}\$, with \$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash approx 0.2 - 0.33\$. Here, we develop a simple analytic model to explain this observation. We begin by considering giant molecular clouds near virial equilibrium and subsequently relate the properties of the cluster to those of the cloud. In turn, we relate the cloud properties to those of the large-scale galactic environment. The model predicts an \textbackslash textit\{initial\} mass-radius relation of constant surface density, \$R\_\{\textbackslash star\} \textbackslash propto M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\^\{1/2\}\$. It also predicts the initial cluster radius depends on the large-scale gas density \$\textbackslash Sigma\_g\$ of the ambient ISM, scaling as \$R\_\{\textbackslash star\} \textbackslash propto \textbackslash Sigma\_g\^\{-1/2\}\$. We argue that the tendency of observed clusters to fall along lines of shallower MRRs than our initial \$R\_\{\textbackslash star\} \textbackslash propto M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\^\{1/2\}\$ is in fact a combination of two effects. The fact that massive clusters can \textbackslash textit\{only\} form in high gas-density environments, when combined with the \$R\_\{\textbackslash star\} \textbackslash propto \textbackslash Sigma\_g\^\{-1/2\}\$ scaling we find here, ultimately shallows the global slope at high masses to nearly \$R\_\{\textbackslash star\} \textbackslash propto M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\^\{1/3\}\$. Meanwhile, at low masses relaxation-driven expansion quickly shallows the MRR. We combine our predicted MRR with a simple population synthesis model and apply it to a range of star-forming environments, from nearby disc galaxies to nuclear starbursts, and find good agreement throughout. We provide quantitative predictions for the radii of proto-globular clusters (GCs) and discuss the implications of the model for GC evolution and survival across cosmic time as well as the dynamical assembly of black hole binaries in stellar clusters.},

Four of these objects are located toward the Galactic center within a solid angle of 21\textdegree. No photoelectric or CCD photometry in the optical domain has been so far reported for five of these objects. Cluster radii are estimated from radial density profiles in the cluster fields. Using the cluster Washington (C-T1,T1) color-magnitude diagrams, statistically cleaned from field star contamination, we estimate reddening, heliocentric distance and age of the clusters by fitting Padova theoretical isochrones computed for the Washington system. In all cases, the best fittings were obtained with nearly solar metal content isochrones. Both radial density profiles and color-magnitude diagrams show that we are dealing with real open clusters, except for Ruprecht 87 and Archinal 1 that are found to be probably not physical systems. Differential reddening appears to be present across the fields of ESO 313-SC03, ESO 129-SC32, BH 217, Collinder 347 and Basel 5.

The estimated linear cluster radii are in the range of 0.4-3.2 pc. In general terms, the results obtained show fairly good agreement with previous photometric results.

  abstract = {Stars originate from the dense interstellar medium, which exhibits filamentary structure to scales of \$\textbackslash sim 1\$ kpc in galaxies like our Milky Way. We explore quantitatively how much resulting large-scale correlation there is among different stellar clusters and associations in \$\textbackslash textit\{orbit phase space\}\$, characterized here by actions and angles. As a starting point, we identified 55 prominent stellar overdensities in the 6D space of orbit (actions) and orbital phase (angles), among the \$\textbackslash sim\$ 2.8 million stars with radial velocities from Gaia EDR3 and \$d \textbackslash leq 800\$ pc. We then explored the orbital \$\textbackslash textit\{phase\}\$ distribution of all sample stars in the same \$\textbackslash textit\{orbit\}\$ patch as any one of these 55 overdensities. We find that very commonly numerous other distinct orbital phase overdensities exist along these same orbits, like pearls on a string. These `pearls' range from known stellar clusters to loose, unrecognized associations. Among orbit patches defined by one initial orbit-phase overdensity 50\% contain at least 8 additional orbital-phase pearls of 10 cataloged members; 20\% of them contain 20 additional pearls. This is in contrast to matching orbit patches sampled from a smooth mock catalog, or random nearby orbit patches, where there are only 2 (or 5, respectively) comparable pearls. Our findings quantify for the first time how common it is for star clusters and associations to form at distinct orbital phases of nearly the same orbit. This may eventually offer a new way to probe the 6D orbit structure of the filamentary interstellar medium.},

  abstract = {The fraction of stars in binary systems within star clusters is important for their evolution, but what proportion of binaries form by dynamical processes after initial stellar accretion remains unknown. In previous work, we showed that dynamical interactions alone produced too few low-mass binaries compared to observations. We therefore implement an initial population of binaries in the coupled MHD and direct N-body star cluster formation code Torch. We compare simulations with, and without, initial binary populations and follow the dynamical evolution of the binary population in both sets of simulations, finding that both dynamical formation and destruction of binaries take place. Even in the first few million years of star formation, we find that an initial population of binaries is needed at all masses to reproduce observed binary fractions for binaries with mass ratios above the \$q \textbackslash geq 0.1\$ detection limit. Our simulations also indicate that dynamical interactions in the presence of gas during cluster formation modify the initial distributions towards binaries with smaller primary masses, larger mass ratios, smaller semi-major axes and larger eccentricities. Systems formed dynamically do not have the same properties as the initial systems, and systems formed dynamically in the presence of an initial population of binaries differ from those formed in simulations with single stars only. Dynamical interactions during the earliest stages of star cluster formation are important for determining the properties of binary star systems.},

We have also created an artificial neural network classifier to identify papers in arXiv which report novel measurements. From the analysis of our results we find that reporting measurements with uncertainties and the correct units is critical information when distinguishing novel measurements in free text. Our results correctly highlight the current tension for measurements of the Hubble constant and recover the \$3.5\textbackslash sigma\$ discrepancy -- demonstrating that the tool presented in this paper is useful for meta-studies of astrophysical measurements from a large number of publications.},

  abstract = {Pisces-Eridanus (Psc-Eri), a nearby (d {$\simeq$} 80-226 pc) stellar stream stretching across {$\approx$}120\textdegree{} of the sky, was recently discovered with Gaia data. The stream was claimed to be {$\approx$}1 Gyr old, which would make it an exceptional discovery for stellar astrophysics, as star clusters of that age are rare and tend to be distant, limiting their utility as benchmark samples. We test this old age for Psc-Eri in two ways. First, we compare the rotation periods for 101 low-mass members (measured using time-series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) to those of well-studied open clusters. Second, we identify 34 new high-mass candidate members, including the notable stars {$\lambda$} Tauri (an Algol-type eclipsing binary) and HD 1160 (host to a directly imaged object near the hydrogen-burning limit). We conduct an isochronal analysis of the color-magnitude data for these highest-mass members, again comparing our results to those for open clusters. Both analyses show that the stream has an age consistent with that of the Pleiades, i.e., {$\approx$}120 Myr. This makes the Psc-Eri stream an exciting source of young benchmarkable stars and, potentially, exoplanets located in a more diffuse environment that is distinct from that of the Pleiades and of other dense star clusters.},

We model the UV-dim stars by assuming that some of the stars which would intrinsically be located on the left side of the eMSTO are obscured by a ring of dust due to grain condensation at the periphery of the excretion disc expelled when they spin at the high rotation rates typical of stars in the Be stage. A reasonably low optical depth at 10{$\mu$} is necessary to model the UV-dim group. Introduction of dust in the interpretation of the eMSTO may require a substantial re-evaluation of previous conclusions concerning the role of age and/or rotation spreads in the MC clusters: the entire eMSTO can be populated by dusty stars, and the reddest UV-dim stars simply represents the tail of the distribution with both maximum obscuration and the dust ring seen along the line of sight. The model stars having higher rotational projected velocity (vsin i) are predicted to be preferentially redder than the slowly rotating stars. The mass-loss responsible for the dust may also cause the non-monotonic distribution of stars in the upper main sequence, with two peaks and gaps showing up in the UV CMD.}

  abstract = {We developed a mathematical model to derive time scales and the presence of BS stars. The model is based on the variation of mass through a circle into the cluster defined by a radius, and at a time; this mass cross is translated into a differential equation that it can be integrated for a given radius (r) and a determined time (t). From this equation we can derive the different time scales that allows us to reach conclusions like: clusters not containing blue strugglers (BS) stars disappear younger than those clusters containing BS. In clusters containing BS stars, the volume which takes up half of the cluster mass is bigger than the one corresponding to clusters without BS stars but the time to catch it up is shorter. We also studied, by means of this equation, the core collapse of stars of the cluster and the region where this concentration is stopped/retained; this region is identified by means of the relation \$c/ch\$, being \$c=\textbackslash log(rt/rc)\$ and \$ch=\textbackslash log(rc/rh)\$. Where rt and rc are the tidal and the core radius respectively, and rh is the radius where half of the cluster mass is concentrated. The model also drove us to the conclusion that the number of the blue straggler stars in a cluster follows a distribution function whose components are the ratio between relaxation time and the age, labelled as \$\textbackslash it f\$, and a factor, named \$\textbackslash varpi\$, which is an indicator of the origin of the BS; \$\textbackslash varpi\$ increases as the number of BS increase but it is limited to\$\textbackslash sim\$5.0. The mentioned distribution function is expressed as \$\textbackslash it NBS\$ \$\textbackslash sim\$ \$\textbackslash it f\^3\$(\$\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{e\^\{\textbackslash frac\{f\}\{\textbackslash varpi\}\}-1\}\$). The validity of this function was carried out by means of matching the number of observed blue straggler (BS) stars to the number of predicted ones in the available sample of OC.},

The 4MOST design is especially intended to complement three key all-sky, space-based observatories of prime European interest: Gaia, eROSITA and Euclid. Initial design and performance estimates for the wide-field corrector concepts are presented. Two fibre positioner concepts are being considered for 4MOST. The first one is a Phi-Theta system similar to ones used on existing and planned facilities. The second one is a new R-Theta concept with large patrol area. Both positioner concepts effectively address the issues of fibre focus and pupil pointing. The 4MOST spectrographs are fixed configuration two-arm spectrographs, with dedicated spectrographs for the high- and low-resolution fibres. A full facility simulator is being developed to guide trade-off decisions regarding the optimal field-of-view, number of fibres needed, and the relative fraction of high-to-low resolution fibres. The simulator takes mock catalogues with template spectra from Design Reference Surveys as starting point, calculates the output spectra based on a throughput simulator, assigns targets to fibres based on the capabilities of the fibre positioner designs, and calculates the required survey time by tiling the fields on the sky. The 4MOST consortium aims to deliver the full 4MOST facility by the end of 2018 and start delivering high-level data products for both consortium and ESO community targets a year later with yearly increments.}

In this work, we present best-fitting multimass models for 37 Milky Way globular clusters, which were inferred from various datasets, including proper motions from Gaia EDR3 and HST, line-of-sight velocities from ground-based spectroscopy and deep stellar mass functions from HST. We use metallicity dependent stellar evolution recipes to obtain present-day mass functions of stars and remnants from the IMF. By dynamically probing the present-day mass function of all objects in a cluster, including the mass distribution of remnants, these models allow us to explore in detail the stellar (initial) mass functions of a large sample of Milky Way GCs. We show that, while the low-mass mass function slopes are strongly dependent on the dynamical age of the clusters, the high-mass slope (\$\textbackslash alpha\_3; m {$>$} 1 M\_\textbackslash odot\$) is not, indicating that the mass function in this regime has generally been less affected by dynamical mass loss. Examination of this high-mass mass function slope suggests an IMF in this mass regime consistent with a Salpeter IMF is required to reproduce the observations. This high-mass IMF is incompatible with a top-heavy IMF, as has been proposed recently. Finally, no significant correlation is found between the high-mass IMF slope and cluster metallicity.},

Building on two basic abstractions, it offers flexible building blocks for probabilistic computation. Distributions provide fast, numerically stable methods for generating samples and computing statistics, e.g., log density. Bijectors provide composable volume-tracking transformations with automatic caching. Together these enable modular construction of high dimensional distributions and transformations not possible with previous libraries (e.g., pixelCNNs, autoregressive flows, and reversible residual networks). They are the workhorse behind deep probabilistic programming systems like Edward and empower fast black-box inference in probabilistic models built on deep-network components. TensorFlow Distributions has proven an important part of the TensorFlow toolkit within Google and in the broader deep learning community.},

  abstract = {We investigate the occurrence of classical (type-I) Cepheid variable stars (henceforth: Cepheids) in dynamically evolving star clusters from birth to an age of approximately 300 Myr. The clusters are modelled by the Aarseth code nbody6, and they feature a realistic stellar initial mass function and initial binary star population, single star and binary star evolution, expulsion of the primordial gas, and the tidal field of the galaxy. Our simulations provide the first detailed dynamical picture of how frequently Cepheids remain gravitationally bound to their birth clusters versus how frequently they occur in the field. They allow us to quantify the relevance of various cluster escape mechanisms and how they depend on stellar mass. Overall, the simulations agree with the empirical picture that a small fraction (\$\textbackslash approx 10\textbackslash\%\$) of Cepheids reside in clusters, that cluster halo membership is relatively common, and that the majority of Cepheid hosting clusters have only a single Cepheid member. Additionally, the simulations predict that a) Cepheid progenitors are much more likely to escape from low-mass than higher-mass clusters; b) higher-mass (long-period) Cepheids are \$\textbackslash approx 30\textbackslash\%\$ more likely to be found in clusters than low-mass (short-period) Cepheids; c) the clustered Cepheid fraction increases with galactocentric radius since cluster dispersal is less efficient at greater radii; d) a lower metallicity reduces the overall clustered Cepheid fraction; e) high-mass clusters are much more likely to have more than one Cepheid member at any given time, in particular at a lower metallicity. We interpret the results as outcomes of various aspects of star cluster dynamics. The comparison of predicted and observed clustered Cepheid fractions, \$f\_\{\textbackslash rm CC\}\$, highlights the need for additional cluster disruption mechanisms, most likely encounters with giant molecular clouds.},

  abstract = {Formation of massive stars within embedded star clusters starts a complex interplay between their feedback, inflowing gas and stellar dynamics, which often includes close stellar encounters. Hydrodynamical simulations usually resort to substantial simplifications to model embedded clusters. Here, we address the simplification which approximates the whole star cluster by a single sink particle, which completely neglects the internal stellar dynamics. In order to model the internal stellar dynamics, we implement a Hermite predictor-corrector integration scheme to the hydrodynamic code FLASH. As we illustrate by a suite of tests, this integrator significantly outperforms the current leap-frog scheme, and it is able to follow the dynamics of small compact stellar systems without the necessity to soften the gravitational potential. We find that resolving individual massive stars instead of representing the whole cluster by a single energetic source has a profound influence on the gas component: for clusters of mass less than \$\textbackslash lesssim 3 \textbackslash times 10\^3 M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, it slows gas expulsion by a factor of \$\textbackslash approx 5\$ to \$\textbackslash approx 1\$ Myr, and it results in substantially more complex gas structures. With increasing cluster mass (up to \$\textbackslash approx 3\textbackslash times 10\^3 M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$), the gas expulsion time-scale slightly decreases. However, more massive clusters (\$\textbackslash gtrsim 5\textbackslash times 10\^3 M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) are unable to clear their natal gas with photoionising radiation and stellar winds only if they form with a star formation efficiency (SFE) of \$1/3\$. This implies that the more massive clusters are either cleared with another feedback mechanism or they form with a SFE higher than \$1/3\$.},

  abstract = {Some of the youngest stars (age \$\textbackslash lesssim 10\$ Myr) are clustered, while many others are observed scattered throughout star forming regions or in complete isolation. It has been intensively debated whether the scattered or isolated stars originate in star clusters, or if they form truly isolated, which could help constrain the possibilities how massive stars are formed. We adopt the assumption that all stars form in gravitationally bound star clusters embedded in molecular cloud cores (\$\textbackslash Gamma\$-\$1\textbackslash;\$ model), which expel their natal gas, and compare the fraction of stars found in clusters with observational data. The star clusters are modelled by the code nbody6, which includes stellar and circumbinary evolution, gas expulsion, and the external gravitational field of their host galaxy. We find that small changes in the assumptions in the current theoretical model estimating the fraction, \$\textbackslash Gamma\$, of stars forming in embedded clusters have a large influence on the results, and we present a counterexample as an illustration. This calls into question theoretical arguments about \$\textbackslash Gamma\$ in embedded clusters, and it suggests that there is no firm theoretical ground for low \$\textbackslash Gamma\$ in galaxies with lower star formation rates (SFRs). Instead, the assumption that all stars form in embedded clusters is in agreement with observational data for the youngest stars (age \$\textbackslash lesssim 10\$ Myr). In the \$\textbackslash Gamma\$-\$1\textbackslash;\$ scenario, the observed fraction of the youngest stars in clusters increases with the SFR only weakly; the increase is caused by the presence of more massive clusters in galaxies with higher SFRs, which release fewer stars to the field in proportion to their mass. The \$\textbackslash Gamma\$-\$1\textbackslash;\$ model yields a higher fraction of stars in clusters for older stars (age between \$10\$ and \$300\$ Myr) than what is observed. This discrepancy can be caused by interactions with molecular clouds.},

The tidal tails (as well as clusters) are integrated from their embedded phase for 300 Myr. We vary star formation efficiencies (SFEs) from 33\% to 100\% and the timescales of gas expulsion as free parameters, and provide predictions for the morphology and kinematics of the evolved tail for each of the models. The resulting tail properties are intended for comparison with anticipated Gaia observations in order to constrain the poorly understood early conditions during the gas phase and gas expulsion. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: The simulations are performed with the code NBODY6 including a realistic external gravitational potential of the Galaxy, and an analytical approximation for the natal gaseous potential. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: Assuming that the Pleiades formed with rapid gas expulsion and an SFE of {$\approx$}30\%, the current Pleiades are surrounded by a rich tail extending from {$\approx$}150 to {$\approx$}350 pc from the cluster and containing 0.7\texttimes{} to 2.7\texttimes{} the number of stars in the present-day cluster. If the Pleiades formed with an SFE close to 100\%, then the tail is shorter ({$\lessequivlnt$}90 pc) and substantially poorer with only {$\approx$}0.02\texttimes{} the number of present-day cluster stars. If the Pleiades formed with an SFE of {$\approx$}30\%, but the gas expulsion was adiabatic, the tail signatures are indistinguishable from the case of the model with 100\% SFE. The mass function of the tail stars is close to that of the canonical mass function for the clusters including primordial gas, but it is slightly depleted of stars more massive than {$\approx$}1 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} for the cluster with 100\% SFE, a difference that is not likely to be observed. The model takes into account the estimated contamination due to the field stars and the Hyades-Pleiades stream, which constitutes a more limiting factor than the accuracy of the Gaia measurements.},

The simulations follow two different spiral arm regions, and the total gas mass is varied to produce a range of different mass clusters. We find that including photoionizing feedback produces the observed cluster mass radius relation, increasing the radii of clusters compared to without feedback. Supernovae have little impact on cluster properties. We find that in our high density, high gas mass simulations, star formation is less affected by feedback, as star formation occurs rapidly before feedback has much impact. In our lowest gas density simulation, the resulting clusters are completely different (e.g. the number of clusters and their masses) to the case with no feedback. The star formation rate is also significantly suppressed. The fraction of stars in clusters in this model decreases with time flattening at about 20\textbackslash\%. In our lowest gas simulation model, we see the formation of a star forming group with properties similar to an OB association, in particular similar to Orion Ia. We suggest that low densities, and stronger initial dynamics are conducive to forming associations rather than clusters. In all models cluster formation is complex with clusters merging and splitting. The most massive clusters which form have tended to undergo more mergers.},

Here, we present the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of nine GCs and the open cluster NGC 6791 in the F110W and F160W bands of HST, showing that the main sequences (MSs) below the knee are either broadened or split thus providing evidence of MPs among VLM stars. In contrast, the MS of NGC 6791 is consistent with a single population. The color distribution of M-dwarfs dramatically changes between different GCs and the color width correlates with the cluster mass. We conclude that the MP ubiquity, variety, and dependence on GC mass are properties common to VLM and more-massive stars. We combined UV, optical, and NIR observations of NGC 2808 and NGC 6121 (M 4) to identify MPs along with a wide range of stellar masses (\textasciitilde{} 0.2 - 0.8M ), from the MS turn off to the VLM regime, and measured, for the first time, their mass functions (MFs). We find that the fraction of MPs does not depend on the stellar mass and that their MFs have similar slopes. These findings indicate that the properties of MPs do not depend on stellar mass. In a scenario where the second generations formed in higher-density environments than the first generations, the possibility that the MPs formed with the same initial MF would suggest that it does not depend on the environment.},

We also measure significant Galactic gradients in O, Mg, S, Ca, Mn, Cr, Cu, Na, Al, and K, some of which are measured for the first time. Our large sample allows us to explore four well-populated age bins to explore the time evolution of gradients for a large number of elements and comment on possible implications for Galactic chemical evolution and radial migration.},

  abstract = {The Gaia satellite will observe the positions and velocities of over a billion Milky Way stars. In the early data releases, the majority of observed stars do not have complete 6D phase-space information. In this Letter, we demonstrate the ability to infer the missing line-of-sight velocities until more spectroscopic observations become available. We utilize a novel neural network architecture that, after being trained on a subset of data with complete phase-space information, takes in a star's 5D astrometry (angular coordinates, proper motions, and parallax) and outputs a predicted line-of-sight velocity with an associated uncertainty. Working with a mock Gaia catalog, we show that the network can successfully recover the distributions and correlations of each velocity component for stars that fall within \$\textbackslash sim 5\$ kpc of the Sun. We also demonstrate that the network can accurately reconstruct the velocity distribution of a kinematic substructure in the stellar halo that is spatially uniform, even when it comprises a small fraction of the total star count.},

  abstract = {We test the Friends-of-Friends (FoF) grouping algorithm, which depends on two linking lengths (LLs), plane-of-sky and line-of-sight (LOS), normalized to the mean nearest neighbor separation of field galaxies. We argue, on theoretical grounds, that LLs should be \$b\_\textbackslash perp \textbackslash simeq 0.11\$, and \$b\_\textbackslash parallel \textbackslash simeq 1.3\$ to recover 95\% of all galaxies with projected radii within the virial radius \$r\_\{200\}\$ and 95\% of the galaxies along the LOS. We then predict that 80 to 90\% of the galaxies in FoF groups should lie within their parent real-space groups (RSGs), defined within their virial spheres. We test the FoF extraction for 16x16 pairs of LLs, using subsamples of galaxies, doubly complete in distance and luminosity, of a flux-limited mock SDSS galaxy catalog. We find that massive RSGs are more prone to fragmentation, while the fragments typically have low estimated mass, with typically 30\% of groups of low and intermediate estimated mass being fragments. Group merging rises drastically with estimated mass. For groups of 3 or more galaxies, galaxy completeness and reliability are both typically better than 80\% (after discarding the fragments). Estimated masses of extracted groups are biased low, by up to a factor 4 at low richness, while the inefficiency of mass estimation improves from 0.85 dex to 0.2 dex when moving from low to high multiplicity groups. The optimal LLs depend on the scientific goal for the group catalog. We propose \$b\_\textbackslash perp \textbackslash simeq 0.07\$, with \$b\_\textbackslash parallel \textbackslash simeq 1.1\$ for studies of environmental effects, \$b\_\textbackslash parallel \textbackslash simeq 2.5\$ for cosmographic studies and \$b\_\textbackslash parallel \textbackslash simeq 5\$ for followups of individual groups.},

We then use this sample to calibrate the published Gaia DR3 parallax uncertainties, making use of the binary components' near-identical parallaxes.

The underestimates are generally \$\textbackslash leq30\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$ for isolated sources with well-behaved astrometry, but are larger (up to \textasciitilde 80 per cent) for apparently well-behaved sources with a companion within {$\lessequivlnt$}4 arcsec, and much larger for sources with poor astrometric fits. We provide an empirical fitting function to inflate published {$\sigma\varpi$} values for isolated sources.

  abstract = {Galaxy cluster counts in bins of mass and redshift have been shown to be a competitive probe to test cosmological models. This method requires an efficient blind detection of clusters from surveys with a well-known selection function and robust mass estimates, which is particularly challenging at high redshift. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15 000 deg2 of the sky, avoiding contamination by light from our Galaxy and our solar system in the optical and near-infrared bands, down to magnitude 24 in the H-band. The resulting data will make it possible to detect a large number of galaxy clusters spanning a wide-range of masses up to redshift {$\sim$}2 and possibly higher. This paper presents the final results of the Euclid Cluster Finder Challenge (CFC), fourth in a series of similar challenges. The objective of these challenges was to select the cluster detection algorithms that best meet the requirements of the Euclid mission. The final CFC included six independent detection algorithms, based on different techniques, such as photometric redshift tomography, optimal filtering, hierarchical approach, wavelet and friend-of-friends algorithms. These algorithms were blindly applied to a mock galaxy catalog with representative Euclid-like properties. The relative performance of the algorithms was assessed by matching the resulting detections to known clusters in the simulations down to masses of M200 {$\sim$} 1013.25 M . Several matching procedures were tested, thus making it possible to estimate the associated systematic effects on completeness to {$<$}3\%. All the tested algorithms are very competitive in terms of performance, with three of them reaching {$>$}80\% completeness for a mean purity of 80\% down to masses of 1014 M and up to redshift z = 2. Based on these results, two algorithms were selected to be implemented in the Euclid pipeline, the Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) code, based on matched filtering, and the PZWav code, based on an adaptive wavelet approach.},

  abstract = {Using the Gaia colour-magnitude diagram, we assign masses to a catalogue of 979 confirmed members of the Hyades cluster and tails. By fitting the cumulative mass profile, stars within the tidal radius have a Plummer-like profile with half-mass radius \$r\_\{\textbackslash rm h\}\$ of 5.75 pc. The tails are extended with \$r\_\{\textbackslash rm h\} = 69.35\$ pc and fall off more slowly than Plummer with density proportional to distance\$\^\{-1.36\}\$. The cluster stars are separated into two groups at BP-RP \$=2\$ or \$0.56 M\_\textbackslash odot\$ to give a high mass (\$\{\textbackslash bar M\} = 0.95 M\_\textbackslash odot\$) and a low mass (\$\{\textbackslash bar M\} = 0.32 M\_\textbackslash odot\$) population. We show that: (i) the high mass population has a half-mass radius \$r\_\{\textbackslash rm h\}\$ of 4.88 pc, whilst the low mass population has \$r\_\{\textbackslash rm h\} = 8.10\$ pc; (ii) despite the differences in spatial extent, the kinematics and binarity properties of the high and low mass populations are similar. They have isotropic velocity ellipsoids with mean 1d velocity dispersions \$\textbackslash sigma\$ of 0.427 and 0.415 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ respectively. The dynamical state of the Hyades is far from energy equipartition (\$\textbackslash sigma \textbackslash propto \{\textbackslash bar M\}\^\{-1/2\}\$). We identify a new mass segregation instability for clusters with escape speed \$V\$. Populations with \$V/\textbackslash sigma \textbackslash lesssim 2\textbackslash sqrt\{2\}\$ can never attain thermal equilibrium and equipartition. This regime encompasses many Galactic open and globular clusters. For the Hyades, there must be an outward energy flux of at least \$9.5 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-4\} M\_\textbackslash odot\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm km\^2\textbackslash, s\^\{-2\} Myr\^\{-1\}\}\$ to maintain its current configuration.

The inferred selection functions have a non-trivial dependence on these observable parameters, demonstrating the importance of empirically estimating selection functions. We also produce a simple estimate for the selection function of the full Gaia EDR3 source catalogue to be used with the subset selection functions. We make all of our selection functions easily accessible through the GitHub repository SELECTIONFUNCTIONS.},

With the friends-of-friends algorithm, we identify 2694 and 9615 Snake member candidates from the two samples. Thirteen open clusters are embedded in these member candidates. By combining the spectroscopic data from multiple surveys, we investigate the comprehensive properties of the candidates and find that they actually belong to one sizable structure, since most of the components are well bridged in their spatial distributions, and follow a single stellar population with an age of \$30-40\$\textbackslash,Myr and with solar metallicity. This sizable structure should be a hierarchically primordial structure, and probably formed from a filamentary giant molecular cloud with different formation history in the local regions. The whole structure is expanding. To further analyze the dynamics of the Snake, we divide the structure into five groups according to their tangential kinematics. We find that the groups are expanding at a coherent rate (\$\textbackslash kappa\_X\textbackslash sim3.0\textbackslash,\textbackslash times10\^\{-2\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm km\textbackslash,s\^\{-1\}\textbackslash,pc\^ \{-1\}\$) in along the length of the structure (\$X\$ direction).

The discoveries were validated by matching near known objects and comparing their mean astrometric parameters with the available literature. A decontamination algorithm was applied to the three-dimensional astrometric space to derive membership likelihoods for clusters stars. By rejecting stars with low membership likelihoods, we built decontaminated colour-magnitude diagrams and derived the clusters astrophysical parameters by isochrone fitting. The structural parameters were also derived by King-profile fittings over the stellar distributions. The investigated clusters are mainly located within 3 kpc from the Sun, with ages ranging from 30 Myr to 3.2 Gyr and reddening limited to E(B-V)=2.5. On average, our cluster sample presents less concentrated structures than Gaia DR2 confirmed clusters, since the derived core radii are larger while the tidal radii are not significantly different. Most of them are located in the IV quadrant of the Galactic disc at low latitudes, therefore they are immersed in dense fields characteristic of the inner Milky Way.},

The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to \$\textbackslash sim N\^2\$ for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation and API. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort. The code is available online at http://dan.iel.fm/emcee under the MIT License.},

A statistical analysis indicates that our sample of 1021 new cluster candidates has a contamination of about 50per cent. Star cluster parameters are obtained by fitting a King profile to the star density. These parameters are used to statistically identify probable new globular cluster candidates in our sample. A detailed investigation of the projected distribution of star clusters in the Galaxy demonstrates that they show a clear tendency to cluster on spatial scales in the order of 12-25pc, a typical size for molecular clouds.},

  abstract = {Open Clusters are born and evolve along the Milky Way plane, on them is imprinted the history of the Galactic disc, including the chemical and dynamical evolution. Chemical and dynamical properties of open clusters can be derived from photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric data of their member stars. Based on the photometric and astrometric data from the Gaia mission, the membership of stars in more than 2000 Galactic clusters has been identified in the literature. The chemical and kinematical properties, however, are still poorly known for many of these clusters. In synergy with the large spectroscopic survey LAMOST (data release 8) and Gaia (data release 2), we report a new comprehensive catalogue of 386 open clusters. This catalogue has homogeneous parameter determinations of radial velocity, metallicity, and dynamical properties, such as orbit, eccentricity, angular momenta, total energy, and 3D Galactic velocity. These parameters allow the first radial velocity determination and the first spectroscopic [Fe/H] determination for 44 and 137 clusters, respectively. The metallicity distribution of majority clusters shows falling trends in the parameter space of the Galactocentric radius, the total energy, and the Z component of angular momentum -- except for two old groups that show flat tails in their own parameter planes. Cluster populations of ages younger and older than 500 Myrs distribute diversely on the disc. The latter has a spatial consistency with the Galactic disc flare. The 3-D spatial comparison between very young clusters ({$<$} 100 Myr) and nearby molecular clouds revealed a wide range of metallicity distribution along the Radcliffe gas cloud wave, indicating a possible inhomogeneous mixing or fast star formation along the wave. This catalogue would serve the community as a useful tool to trace the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Milky Way.},

Combining direct \$N\$-body code with smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code, we have developed a new code, \textbackslash textsc\{ASURA+BRIDGE\}, in which we can integrate stellar particles without softening. We add a feedback model for \textbackslash HII regions into this code, in which thermal and momentum feedback is given within the Str\{\textbackslash "o\}mgren radius. We perform \$N\$-body/SPH simulations of star cluster formation. Without softening, a portion of massive stars are ejected from the forming clusters. As a result, the stellar feedback works outside the clusters. This enhances/suppresses the star formation in initially sub-virial/super-virial clouds. We find that the formed star clusters are denser than currently observed open clusters, but the mass--density relation is consistent with or even higher than that is estimated as an initial cluster density. We also find that some clusters have multiple peaks in their stellar age distribution as a consequence of their hierarchical formation.},

If a planet population from 0.01\textendash 100 AU in an open cluster initially follows the probability distribution function of exoplanets with semi-major axis (\emph{a{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{p{$<$}sub/{$>$}) between 0.03 and 3 AU in the field discovered by RV surveys ( ), the PDF of surviving planets beyond \textasciitilde 10 AU in open clusters can be slightly modified to .

  abstract = {We study star cluster formation in various environments with different metallicities and column densities by performing a suite of three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We find that the photoionization feedback from massive stars controls the star formation efficiency (SFE) in a star-forming cloud, and its impact sensitively depends on the gas metallicity \$Z\$ and initial cloud surface density \$\textbackslash Sigma\$. At \$Z=1\textasciitilde Z\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, for instance, the SFE increases from 0.02 to 0.3 with \$\textbackslash Sigma\$ from \$10\$ to \$300\textasciitilde\{\textbackslash rm M\_\{\textbackslash odot\} \{\textbackslash rm pc\^\{-2\}\}\}\$. In low-metallicity cases \$10\^\{-2\}- 10\^\{-1\} Z\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, star clusters form from atomic warm gases because the molecule formation time is not short enough with respect to the cooling or dynamical time. In addition, the whole cloud is disrupted more easily by expanding HII bubbles which have higher temperature owing to less efficient cooling. With smaller dust attenuation, the ionizing radiation feedback from nearby massive stars is stronger and terminate star formation in dense clumps. These effects result in inefficient star formation in low-metallicity environments: the SFE is reduced by a factor of \$\textbackslash sim 0.3\$ for the cases with \$Z=10\^\{-2\}\textasciitilde Z\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ regardless of \$\textbackslash Sigma\$. Newborn star clusters are also gravitationally less bound. We further develop a new semi-analytical model that can reproduce the simulation results well, particularly the observed dependencies of the SFEs on the cloud surface densities and metallicities.},

  abstract = {We propose that fourteen co-moving groups of stars uncovered by Kounkel \& Covey (2019) may be related to known nearby moving groups and bridge those and nearby open clusters with similar ages and space velocities. This indicates that known nearby moving groups may be spatially much more extended than previously though, and some of them might be parts of tidal tails around the cores of known open clusters, reminiscent of those recently found around the Hyades and a handful of other nearby clusters. For example, we find that both the nearby Carina and Columba associations may be linked to Theia 208 from Kounkel \& Covey (2019) and together form parts of a large tidal tail around the Platais 8 open cluster. The AB Doradus moving group and Theia 301 may form a trailing tidal tail behind the Pleiades open cluster, with hints of a possible leading tidal tail in Theia 369. We similarly find that IC 2391 and its tidal tails identified by Meingast et al. (2021) may be extended by the nearby Argus association and are possibly further extended by Theia 115. The nearby Octans and Octans-Near associations, as well as Theia 94 and 95, may form a large tidal tail leading the poorly studied Platais 5 open cluster candidate. While a preliminary analysis of Gaia color-magnitude sequences hint that these structures are plausibly related, more observational evidence is still required to corroborate their consistent ages and space velocities. These observations may change our current understanding of nearby moving groups and the different pathways through which they can form. While some moving groups may have formed loosely in extended star-formation events with rich spatial structure, others may in fact correspond to the tidal tails of nearby open clusters.},

  abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. {$<$}P /{$><$}A href="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia"{$>$}http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia{$<$}/A{$>$}},

  abstract = {We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (G\_BP-G\_RP) colour are also available. The passbands for G, G\_BP, and G\_RP are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 percent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30--40 percent for the parallaxes and by a factor \textasciitilde 2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, G\_BP, and G\_RP is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1 percent level.},

  abstract = {Methods. The Gaia DR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium. Results. The Gaia DR3 catalogue contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and broad band photometry in the G, GBP, and GRP pass-bands already present in the Early Third Data Release, Gaia EDR3. Gaia DR3 introduces an impressive wealth of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges GRVS {$<$} 14 and 3100 {$<$} Teff {$<$} 14500, have new determinations of their mean radial velocities based on data collected by Gaia. We provide GRVS magnitudes for most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed for a subset of these. Mean Gaia spectra are made available to the community. The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism photometer BP/RP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. Gaia DR3 includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470 million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some 800 000 astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than 150 000 Solar System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra derived from the epoch BP/RP spectral data are published for about 60 000 asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey, consisting of the photometric time series for all sources located in a 5.5 degree radius field centred on the Andromeda galaxy. Conclusions. This data release represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 and Gaia EDR3 because of the unprecedented quantity, quality, and variety of source astrophysical data. To date this is the largest collection of all-sky spectrophotometry, radial velocities, variables, and astrophysical parameters derived from both low- and high-resolution spectra and includes a spectrophotometric and dynamical survey of SSOs of the highest accuracy. The non-single star content surpasses the existing data by orders of magnitude. The quasar host and galaxy light profile collection is the first such survey that is all sky and space based. The astrophysical information provided in Gaia DR3 will unleash the full potential of Gaia's exquisite astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity surveys.},

  abstract = {Context. At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data release, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7. Aims: A summary of Gaia DR1 is presented along with illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Methods: The raw data collected by Gaia during the first 14 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into an astrometric and photometric catalogue. Results: Gaia DR1 consists of three components: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues - a realisation of the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) - and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set, consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of 3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas yr-1 for the proper motions. A systematic component of 0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of 94 000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas yr-1. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is 10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to 0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. Conclusions: Gaia DR1 is an important milestone ahead of the next Gaia data release, which will feature five-parameter astrometry for all sources. Extensive validation shows that Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

  abstract = {Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {The census of the globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way (MW) is still a work in progress. We explore the nature of 19 new GC candidates in the Galactic bulge, based on the analysis of their colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) in the near-IR, using the VISTA Variables in the Via L\textbackslash 'actea Survey (VVV) database. We estimate their main astrophysical parameters: reddening and extinction, distance, total luminosity, mean cluster proper motions (PMs), metallicity and age. We obtain the cluster catalogues including the likely cluster members by applying a decontamination procedure on the observed CMDs, based upon the vector PM diagrams from VIRAC2. We estimate a wide reddening range of the \$0.25 \textbackslash leqslant E(J-K\_s) \textbackslash leqslant 2.0\$ mag and extinction \$0.11 \textbackslash leqslant A\_\{Ks\} \textbackslash leqslant 0.86\$ mag for the sample clusters as expected in the bulge regions. The range of heliocentric distances is \$6.8\textbackslash leqslant D\textbackslash leqslant 11.4\$ kpc. This allows us to place these clusters between 0.56 and 3.25 kpc from the Galactic centre, assuming \$R\_\{\textbackslash odot\}=8.2\$ kpc. Also, their PMs are kinematically similar to the typical motion of the Galactic bulge, apart from VVV-CL160, which shows different PMs. We also derive their metallicities and ages, finding \$-1.40 \textbackslash leqslant\$ [Fe/H] \$\textbackslash leqslant 0.0\$ dex and \$t\textbackslash approx 8-13\$ Gyr respectively. The luminosities are calculated both in \$K\_\{s\}-\$ and V-bands, recovering \$-3.4 \textbackslash leqslant M\_V \textbackslash leqslant -7.5\$. We also examine the possible RR Lyrae members found in the cluster fields. Based on their positions, kinematics, metallicities and ages and comparing our results with the literature, we conclude that 9 candidates are real GCs, 7 need more observations to be fully confirmed as GCs, whereas 3 candidates are discarded for being younger open clusters.},

  abstract = {The Galactic globular cluster system is incomplete, especially in the low latitude regions of the Galactic bulge and disk. We report the physical characterization of twelve star clusters in the Milky Way, most of which are explored here for the first time. Our aim is determining their main physical parameters, such as reddening and extinction, metallicity, age, total luminosity, mean cluster proper motions (PMs), distances, in order to unveil their physical nature. We study the clusters using optical and near-infrared (NIR) datasets. We use the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) PMs in order to perform a PM-decontamination procedure and build final catalogues. We match the Gaia EDR3 with the VISTA Variables in the V\textbackslash 'ia L\textbackslash 'actea extended (VVVX) survey and Two Micron All Sky survey (2MASS) in the NIR, in order to construct complete colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and investigate the clusters properties. The extinctions are evaluated using existing reddening maps, spanning \$0.09\textbackslash lesssim A\_\{Ks\}\textbackslash lesssim 0.86\$ mag and \$0.89 \textbackslash lesssim A\_\{G\}\textbackslash lesssim 4.72\$ mag in the NIR and optical, respectively. We obtain their heliocentric distances, that range from about 4 to 20 kpc, placing these clusters at \$3\textbackslash lesssim R\_\{G\}\textbackslash lesssim 14\$ kpc from the Galactic centre. The best PARSEC isochrone fit yields a metallicity range of \$-1.8{$<\$$}[Fe/H]\${$<$}+0.3\$ and an approximative age range of \$2{$<\$$}Age\${$<$}14\$ Gyr.

To date, we analysed a region of 23 sq. deg. in the outskirts of the Large Magellanic Cloud, detecting 85 bona-fide cluster candidates, 16 of which have estimated ages falling in the so called "age gap".

  abstract = {Many young extra-galactic clusters have a measured velocity dispersion that is too high for the mass derived from their age and total luminosity, which has led to the suggestion that they are not in virial equilibrium. Most of these clusters are confined to a narrow age range centred around 10Myr because of observational constraints. At this age, the cluster light is dominated by luminous evolved stars, such as red supergiants, with initial masses of \textasciitilde 13-22Msolar for which (primordial) binarity is high. In this study, we investigate to what extent the observed excess velocity dispersion is the result of the orbital motions of binaries. We demonstrate that estimates for the dynamical mass of young star clusters, derived from the observed velocity dispersion, exceed the photometric mass by up to a factor of 10 and are consistent with a constant offset in the square of the velocity dispersion. This can be reproduced by models of virialized star clusters hosting a massive star population of which \textasciitilde 25 per cent is in binaries, with typical mass ratios of \textasciitilde 0.6 and periods of \textasciitilde 1000 d. We conclude that binaries play a pivotal role in deriving the dynamical masses of young (\textasciitilde 10Myr), moderately massive and compact ({$<\sptilde$}105Msolar {$>\sptilde$}1pc) star clusters.},

  abstract = {The spatial and dynamical structure of star-forming regions can help provide insights on stellar formation patterns. The amount of data from current and upcoming surveys calls for robust and objective procedures to detect structure, so the results can be statistically analysed and different regions compared. We provide the community with a tool able to detect the small scale significant structure, above random expectation, in star-forming regions, which could be the imprint of the stellar formation process. The tool makes use of the one point correlation function and of nearest neighbour statistics to determine the parameters for the DBSCAN algorithm. The procedure successfully detects significant small scale substructures in heterogeneous regions, fulfilling the goals it was designed for, and providing very reliable structures. The analysis of regions close to complete spatial randomness (\$Q \textbackslash in [0.7,0.87]\$) shows that, even when some structure is present and recovered, it is hardly distinguishable from spurious detection in homogeneous regions due to projection effects. Interpretation should thus be done with care. For concentrated regions, we detect a main structure surrounded by smaller ones, corresponding to the core plus some Poisson fluctuations around it. We argue that these structures do not correspond to the small compact regions we are looking for. In some realistic cases, a more complete hierarchical, multi-scale analysis would be needed to capture the complexity of the region. We have developed implementations of our procedure, and a catalogue of the NESTs (Nested Elementary STructures) detected by it in four star-forming regions (Taurus, IC 348, Upper Scorpius, and Carina), which are publicly available to the community. Implementations of the 3D, and up to 6D versions of the procedure including proper movements are in progress, and will be provided as future work.},

During this early stage, the evolution of the two simulations is very similar (implying that the feedback from low mass stars does not affect the cloud-scale evolution significantly) and the star-forming region accretes faster than it can convert gas to stars, causing the instantaneous measured star formation efficiency (SFE) to remain low even in the absence of significant feedback. Afterwards, the ionising feedback first destroys the filamentary supply to star-forming hubs and ultimately removes the gas from it, thus first reducing the star formation (SF) and finally halting it. The ionising feedback also affects the initial kinematics and spatial distribution of the forming stars, because the gas being dispersed continues to form stars, which inherit its motion. In the non-feedback simulation, the groups remain highly compact and do not mix, while in the run with feedback, the gas dispersal causes each group to expand, and the cluster expansion thus consists of the combined expansion of the groups. Most secondary star-forming sites around the main hub are also present in the non-feedback run, implying a primordial rather than triggered nature. We do find one example of a peripheral star-forming site that appears only in the feedback run, thus having a triggered origin. However, this appears to be the exception rather than the rule, although this may be an artifact of our simplified radiative transfer scheme.},

We explore the effects of extended star formation (eSF) and a range of stellar rotation rates on the behavior of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), paying particular attention to the MSTO. We create synthetic stellar populations based on MESA stellar models to simulate observed Hubble Space Telescope and Gaia star cluster data. We model the effect of rotation as a non-parametric distribution, allowing for maximum flexibility. In our models the slow rotators comprise the blueward, and fast rotators the redward portion of the eMSTO. We simulate data under three scenarios: non-rotating eSF, a range of rotation rates with a single age, and a combination of age and rotation effects. We find that two of the five clusters (the youngest and oldest) favor an age spread, but these also achieve the overall worst fits of all clusters. The other three clusters show comparable statistical evidence between rotation and an age spread. In all five cases, a rotation rate distribution alone is capable of qualitatively matching the observed eMSTO structure. In future work, we aim to compare our predicted Vsin(i) with observations in order to better constrain the physics related to stellar rotation.},

Paradoxically, we have a better census of nearby embedded young populations than the slightly more evolved optically visible young populations. The high accuracy measurements and all-sky coverage of Gaia data are about to change this situation. Aims. This work aims to construct the most complete sample to date of YSOs in the \$\textbackslash rho\$ Oph region. Methods. We compile a catalog of 1114 Ophiuchus YSOs from the literature and crossmatch it with the Gaia EDR3, Gaia-ESO and APOGEE-2 surveys. We apply a multivariate classification algorithm to this catalog to identify new, co-moving population candidates. Results. We find 191 new high-fidelity YSO candidates in the Gaia EDR3 catalog belonging to the \$\textbackslash rho\$ Oph region. The new sources appear to be mainly Class III M-stars and substellar objects and are less extincted than the known members. We find 28 previously unknown sources with disks. The analysis of the proper motion distribution of the entire sample reveals a well-defined bimodality, implying two distinct populations sharing a similar 3D volume. The first population comprises young stars' clusters around the \$\textbackslash rho\$ Ophiuchi star and the main Ophiuchus clouds (L1688, L1689, L1709). In contrast, the second population is older (\$\textbackslash sim\$ 10 Myr), dispersed, has a distinct proper motion, and is possibly from the Upper Sco group. The two populations are moving away from each other at about 4.1 km/s, and will no longer overlap in about 4 Myr. Finally, we flag 17 sources in the literature as impostors, which are sources that exhibit large deviations from the average distance and proper motion properties of the \$\textbackslash rho\$ Oph population. Our results show the importance of accurate 3D space and motion information for improved stellar population analysis. (Abridged)},

  abstract = {Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task often used to discover meaningful structures in data, such as phylogenetic trees, taxonomies of concepts, subtypes of cancer, and cascades of particle decays in particle physics. When multiple hierarchical clusterings of the data are possible, it is useful to represent uncertainty in the clustering through various probabilistic quantities, such as the distribution over tree structures and the marginal probabilities of subtrees. Existing approaches represent uncertainty for a range of models; however, they only provide \textbackslash emph\{approximate\} inference. This paper presents dynamic-programming algorithms and proofs for \textbackslash emph\{exact\} inference in hierarchical clustering at small but useful scales. We are able to compute the partition function, MAP hierarchical clustering, and marginal probabilities of sub-hierarchies and clusters. Our method supports a wide range of hierarchical clustering models and only requires a cluster compatibility function. Rather than scaling with the number of hierarchical clusterings of \$N\$ elements ((2N-3)!!), our approach runs in time and space proportional to the significantly smaller powerset of \$N\$. Despite still being large, there are many important applications at the practically-computable range of \$N {$<$} 20\$. We demonstrate the advantages of exact inference on synthetic data of interest to Dasgupta's cost as well as on two real world applications, in particle physics at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and in cancer genomics.},

  abstract = {The properties of young star clusters formed within a galaxy are thought to vary in different interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, but the details of this mapping from galactic to cluster scales are poorly understood due to the large dynamic range involved in galaxy and star cluster formation. We introduce a new method for modeling cluster formation in galaxy simulations: mapping giant molecular clouds (GMCs) formed self-consistently in a FIRE-2 MHD galaxy simulation onto a cluster population according to a GMC-scale cluster formation model calibrated to higher-resolution simulations, obtaining detailed properties of the galaxy's star clusters in mass, metallicity, space, and time. We find \$\textbackslash sim 10\textbackslash\%\$ of all stars formed in the galaxy originate in gravitationally-bound clusters overall, and this fraction increases in regions with elevated \$\textbackslash Sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm gas\}\$ and \$\textbackslash Sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm SFR\}\$, because such regions host denser GMCs with higher star formation efficiency. These quantities vary systematically over the history of the galaxy, driving variations in cluster formation. The mass function of bound clusters varies -- no single Schechter-like or power-law distribution applies at all times. In the most extreme episodes, clusters as massive as \$7\textbackslash times 10\^6 M\_\textbackslash odot\$ form in massive, dense clouds with high star formation efficiency. The initial mass-radius relation of young star clusters is consistent with an environmentally-dependent 3D density that increases with \$\textbackslash Sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm gas\}\$ and \$\textbackslash Sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm SFR\}\$. The model does not reproduce the age and metallicity statistics of old (\${$>$}11\textbackslash rm Gyr\$) globular clusters found in the Milky Way, possibly because it forms stars more slowly at \$z{$>$}3\$.},

It is found that oncethe clouds disperse due to stellar feedback, both self-gravitating star clusters and unbound stars generally remain, which arise from the same underlying continuum of substructured stellar density, ie. the hierarchical cluster formation scenario. The fraction of stars that are born within gravitationally-bound star clusters is related to the overall cloud star formation efficiency set by stellar feedback, but has significant scatter due to stochastic variations in the small-scale details of the star-forming gas flow. We use our numerical results to calibrate a model for mapping the bulk properties (mass, size, and metallicity) of self-gravitating GMCs onto the star cluster populations they form, expressed statistically in terms of cloud-level distributions. Synthesizing cluster catalogues from an observed GMC catalogue in M83, we find that this model predicts initial star cluster masses and sizes that are in good agreement with observations, using only standard IMF and stellar evolution models as inputs for feedback. Within our model, the ratio of the strength of gravity to stellar feedback is the key parameter setting the masses of star clusters, and of the various feedback channels direct stellar radiation(photon momentum and photoionization) is the most important on GMC scales.},

We use the GIZMO code with the MFM mesh-free Lagrangian MHD method, augmented with new algorithms for gravity, timestepping, sink particle formation and accretion, stellar dynamics, and feedback coupling. We survey a wide range of numerical parameters/prescriptions for sink formation and accretion and find very small variations in star formation history and the IMF (except for intentionally-unphysical variations). Modules for mass-injecting feedback (winds, SNe, and jets) inject new gas elements on-the-fly, eliminating the lack of resolution in diffuse feedback cavities otherwise inherent in Lagrangian methods. The treatment of radiation uses GIZMO's radiative transfer solver to track 5 frequency bands (IR, optical, NUV, FUV, ionizing), coupling direct stellar emission and dust emission with gas heating and radiation pressure terms. We demonstrate accurate solutions for SNe, winds, and radiation in problems with known similarity solutions, and show that our jet module is robust to resolution and numerical details, and agrees well with previous AMR simulations. STARFORGE can scale up to massive (\${$>$}10\^5 M\_\textbackslash odot \$) GMCs on current supercomputers while predicting the stellar (\$\textbackslash gtrsim 0.1 M\_\textbackslash odot\$) range of the IMF, permitting simulations of both high- and low-mass cluster formation in a wide range of conditions.},

The central part of the cluster was observed in a 200 x 200 pixel `superstamp' during these four years in 30-minute cadence photometry, providing a unique long time-series high-precision data set. The cluster contains 'blue straggler' stars, i.e., stars on the main sequence above the cluster turnoff that should have left the main sequence to become red giants. We present light curves and pulsation frequency analyses derived from custom photometric reductions for five confirmed cluster members--four blue stragglers and one star near the main-sequence turnoff. Two of these stars show a rich spectrum of \$\textbackslash delta\$ Scuti pulsation modes, with 236 and 124 significant frequencies identified, respectively, while two stars show mainly low-frequency modes, characteristic of \$\textbackslash gamma\$ Doradus variable stars. The fifth star, a known active x-ray binary, shows only several harmonics of two main frequencies. For the two \$\textbackslash delta\$ Scuti stars, we use a frequency separation--mean-density relation to estimate mean density, and then use this value along with effective temperature to derive stellar mass and radius. For the two stars showing low frequencies, we searched for period-spacing sequences that may be representative of gravity-mode or Rossby-mode sequences, but found no clear sequences. The common age for the cluster members, considered along with the frequencies, will provide valuable constraints for asteroseismic analyses, and may shed light on the origin of the blue stragglers.},

  abstract = {Several observational and theoretical indications suggest that the initial mass function (IMF) becomes increasingly top-heavy (i.e., overabundant in high-mass stars with mass \$m {$>$} 1M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) with decreasing metallicity and increasing gas density of the forming object. This affects the evolution of globular clusters (GCs) owing to the different mass-loss rates and the number of black holes formed. Previous numerical modeling of GCs usually assumed an invariant canonical IMF. Using the state-of-the-art \$NBODY6\$ code, we perform a comprehensive series of direct \$N\$-body simulations to study the evolution of star clusters, starting with a top-heavy IMF and undergoing early gas expulsion. Utilizing the embedded cluster mass-radius relation of Marks \& Kroupa (2012) for initializing the models, and by varying the degree of top-heaviness, we calculate the minimum cluster mass needed for the cluster to survive longer than 12 Gyr. We document how the evolution of different characteristics of star clusters such as the total mass, the final size, the density, the mass-to-light ratio, the population of stellar remnants, and the survival of GCs is influenced by the degree of top-heaviness. We find that the lifetimes of clusters with different IMFs moving on the same orbit are proportional to the relaxation time to a power of \$x\$ that is in the range of 0.8 to 1. The observed correlation between concentration and the mass function slope in Galactic GCs can be accounted for excellently in models starting with a top-heavy IMF and undergoing an early phase of rapid gas expulsion.},

The Database for Galactic Open Clusters (WEBDA) also lists Lod\'en 1 as a 2 Gyr cluster at a distance of 360 pc. If this is true, Lod\'en 1 could become a useful benchmark cluster. This work details our investigation of Lod\'en 1. We assembled archival astrometry (PPMXL) and photometry (2MASS, Tycho-2, APASS), and acquired medium resolution spectra for radial velocity measurements with the Robert Stobie Spectrograph at the Southern African Large Telescope. We observed no sign of a cluster main-sequence turnoff or red giant branch among all stars in the field brighter than . Considering the 29 stars identified by L.O. Lod\'en and listed on SIMBAD as the members of Lod\'en 1, we found no compelling evidence of kinematic clustering in proper motion or radial velocity. Most of these candidates are A stars and red giants, and their observed properties are consistent with distant field stars in the direction of Lod\'en 1 in the Galactic plane. We conclude that the old nearby cluster Lod\'en 1 is neither old, nor nearby, nor a cluster.},

With the high-precision astrometric data of Gaia EDR3, we have developed a methodology to unveil the rotational properties of the Praesepe cluster. Statistics of the three-dimensional residual motions of the member stars reveal the presence of Praesepe's rotation and determine its spatial rotation axis. The mean rotation velocity of the Praesepe cluster within its tidal radius is estimated to be 0.2 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.05 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$, and the corresponding rotation axis is tilted in relation to the Galactic plane with an angle of 41 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 12 degree. We also analysed the rms rotational velocity of the member stars around the rotation axis, and found that the rotation of the member stars within the tidal radius of Praesepe probably follows the Newton's classical theorems.},

For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

We find that eight out of ten constrained clusters (80\%) have spin-axis orientations consistent with isotropy, and we establish a lower limit of four out of ten (40\%) isotropic clusters at 75\% confidence, assuming no correlation of spins between clusters. We also identify two clusters whose spin-axis distributions can be better described by a model consisting of an aligned fraction of stars combined with an isotropic distribution. However, the inclination values of these stars may be influenced by systematic error, and the small number of stars modeled as aligned in these two clusters precludes the interpretation that their stellar subsets are physically aligned. Overall, no cluster displays an unambiguous signature of spin alignment, and 97\% of the stars in our sample are consistent with isotropic orientations in their respective clusters. Our results offer support for the dominance of turbulence over ordered rotation in clumps and do not suggest alignment of rotation axes and magnetic fields in protostars.},

For comparison, we also compiled [Fe/H] estimates based on spectra with low and intermediate resolution. At medium and high resolution, we found that differences in the analysis methods have a stronger effect on the metallicity than that of quality differences in the observations. We retained only highly probable cluster members and introduced a restriction on atmospheric parameters. Results. We combined 641 individual metallicity values for 458 stars in 78 open clusters from 86 publications to form our final set of high-quality cluster metallicities. The photometric metallicities discussed in the first paper of this series are systematically lower than the spectroscopic ones by about 0.1 dex, and the differences show a scatter of about 0.2 dex. In a preliminary comparison of our spectroscopic sample with models of Galactic chemical evolution, none of the models predicts the observed radial metallicity gradient. Conclusions. Photometric metallicities show a large intrinsic dispersion, while the more accurate spectroscopic sample presented in this paper comprises fewer than half the number of clusters. Only a sophisticated combination of all available photometric and spectroscopic data will allow us to trace the metallicity distribution in the Galactic disk on a local and global scale.},

  abstract = {The advent of Gaia's 2nd data release in combination with large spectroscopic surveys are revolutionizing our understanding of the Galaxy. Thanks to these and the knowledge accumulated thus far, a more mature picture of the evolution of the early Milky Way is emerging: * Two of the traditional Galactic components, i.e. the stellar halo and the thick disk, appear to be intimately linked: stars with halo-like kinematics originate in similar proportions, from a "heated" (thick) disk and from debris from a system named Gaia-Enceladus. Gaia-Enceladus was the last big merger event experienced by the Milky Way and probably completed around 10 Gyr ago. The puffed-up stars now present in the halo as a consequence of the merger have thus exposed the existence of a disk component at z \textasciitilde{} 1.8. * The Helmi streams, Sequoia, and Thamnos are amongst the newly uncovered or better characterized merger events. Knowledge of their progenitor's properties, star formation and chemical histories is still incomplete. * Debris' from different objects often overlap in phase-space. A task for the next years will be to use spectroscopic surveys for chemical labelling and to disentangle events from one another using dimensions other than only phase-space, metallicity or [alpha/Fe]. * These surveys will also provide line-of-sight velocities missing for faint stars and more accurate distance determinations for distant objects. The resulting samples of stars will cover a much wider volume of the Galaxy allowing, for example, linking kinematic substructures in the inner halo to spatial overdensities in the outer halo. * All the results obtained so far are in-line with expectations of current cosmological models. Yet, tailored hydrodynamical simulations as well as "constrained" cosmological simulations are needed to push our knowledge of the assembly of the Milky Way back to the earliest times. [abridged]},

  abstract = {Most stars are formed as star clusters in galaxies, which then disperse into galactic disks. Upcoming exascale supercomputational facilities will enable performing simulations of galaxies and their formation by resolving individual stars (star-by-star simulations). This will substantially advance our understanding of star formation in galaxies, star cluster formation, and assembly histories of galaxies. In previous galaxy simulations, a simple stellar population approximation was used. It is, however, difficult to improve the mass resolution with this approximation. Therefore, a model for forming individual stars that can be used in simulations of galaxies must be established. In this first paper of a series of the SIRIUS (SImulations Resolving IndividUal Stars) project, we propose and demonstrate a new stochastic star formation model for star-by-star simulations. In this model, an assumed stellar initial mass function (IMF) is randomly assigned to newly formed stars. We then introduce a maximum search radius to assemble the mass from surrounding gas particles to form star particles. In this study, we perform a series of \$N\$-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of star cluster formations from turbulent molecular clouds as test cases. The IMF can be correctly sampled if a maximum search radius that is larger than the value estimated from the threshold density for star formation is adopted. In small clouds, the formation of massive stars is highly stochastic because of the small number of stars. We confirm that the star formation efficiency and threshold density do not strongly affect the results. Herein, we demonstrate that our models can be applied to simulations varying from star clusters to galaxies for a wide range of resolutions.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

  abstract = {We study the impact of accretion from protoplanetary discs on stellar evolution of AFG-type stars. We use a simplified disc model computed using the Two-Pop-Py code that contains the growth and drift of dust particles in the protoplanetary disc. It is used to model the accretion scenarios for a range of physical conditions of protoplanetary discs. Two limiting cases are combined with the evolution of stellar convective envelopes computed using the Garstec stellar evolution code. We find that the accretion of metal-poor (gas) or metal-rich (dust) material has a significant impact on the chemical composition of the stellar convective envelope. As a consequence, the evolutionary track of the star diverts from the standard scenario predicted by canonical stellar evolution models, which assume a constant and homogeneous chemical composition after the assembly of the star has finished. In the case of the Sun, we find a modest impact on the solar chemical composition. Accretion of metal-poor material indeed reduces the overall metallicity of the solar atmosphere, and it is consistent, within the uncertainty, with the solar Z reported by Caffau et al. (2011), but our model is not consistent with the measurement by Asplund et al. (2009). Another effect is the change of the position of the star in the colour-magnitude diagram. We compare our predictions to a set of open clusters from the Gaia DR2 and show that it is possible to produce a scatter close to the turn-off of young clusters that could contribute to explain the observed scatter in CMDs. Detailed measurements of metallicities and abundances in the nearby open clusters will provide a stringent observational test of our proposed scenario.},

We aim to test if: i) star cluster formation proceeds according to universal physical processes, suggestive of a common formation mechanism for young-massive clusters (YMCs), intermediate-age clusters (IACs), and ancient globular clusters (GCs); ii) massive clusters of all ages trace a continuous AMR; iii) the AMRs of smaller mass galaxies show a shallower relation when compared to more massive galaxies. Our results show that, within the uncertainties, the predicted AMRs of L/SMC-mass galaxies with similar star formation histories to the L/SMC follow the same relation as observations. We also find that the metallicity at which the AMR saturates increases with galaxy mass, which is also found for the field star AMRs. This suggests that relatively low-metallicity clusters can still form in dwarfs galaxies. Given our results, we suggest that ancient GCs share their formation mechanism with IACs and YMCs, in which GCs are the result of a universal process of star cluster formation during the early episodes of star formation in their host galaxies.},

This algorithm uses a Bayesian deconvolution approach, based on an empirical HR-diagram representative of the local thin disk, in order to map the extinction as a function of distance of various fields of view. Results. We analysed more than 5.6 million stars to obtain an extinction map of the entire Galactic disk within \$|b|{$<$}0.24\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$. This map provides information up to \$5\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{kpc\}\$ in the direction of the Galactic centre and at more than \$7\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{kpc\}\$ in the direction of the anticentre. This map reveals the complete shape of structures known locally, such as the Vela complex or the split of the local arm. Furthermore our extinction map shows many large "clean bubbles" especially one in the Sagittarius -- Carina complex, and four others which define a structure that we nickname the butterfly.},

A recent paper reinterpreted the technique as a specific algorithm for approximate inference in Bayesian neural networks; several extensions ensued. We show that the log-uniform prior used in all the above publications does not generally induce a proper posterior, and thus Bayesian inference in such models is ill-posed. Independent of the log-uniform prior, the correlated weight noise approximation has further issues leading to either infinite objective or high risk of overfitting. The above implies that the reported sparsity of obtained solutions cannot be explained by Bayesian or the related minimum description length arguments. We thus study the objective from a non-Bayesian perspective, provide its previously unknown analytical form which allows exact gradient evaluation, and show that the later proposed additive reparametrisation introduces minima not present in the original multiplicative parametrisation. Implications and future research directions are discussed.},

The results show that the overall shape of sample clusters becomes more elliptical as they grow older, while their core remains circular or slightly trend to circularize. There is a negative correlation of the ellipticities with the number of members of the sample clusters. A significant negative correlation between the overall ellipticities and masses is also detected for the sample clusters with log(age/year) \$\textbackslash geq\$ 8, suggesting that the overall shapes of the clusters are possibly influenced by the number of members and masses, in addition to the external forces and the surrounding environment. For most young sample clusters, the radial stratification degree of the short axis direction is greater than that of the long, implying that the radial stratification degree in the two directions within the young sample cluster may be unevenly affected by an internal evolutionary process. Older sample clusters exhibit lower stratification in the tangential direction, which possibly means those clusters may continue to survive for a long time at a low level of stratification. Our analysis shows that the overall shape of the sample clusters may be more susceptible to the influence of Galactic tides toward the Galactic center than the shear forces embedded in Galactic differential rotation. By analyzing the distribution of the ages and number of members of star clusters, we suggest that NGC 6791 may originate from superclusters.},

Using the kernel density estimation of stellar number counts, we identify eleven possible GC candidates. Crossed-matched with existing imaging data, all eleven objects are known either GCs or galaxies and only Fornax GC 1-6 among them are associated with the targeted dwarf galaxy. Using simulated GCs, we calculate the GC detection limit \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm V\}\^\{\textbackslash rm lim\}\$ that spans the range from \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm V\}\^\{\textbackslash rm lim\} \textbackslash sim -7\$ for distant dwarfs to \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm V\}\^\{\textbackslash rm lim\} \textbackslash sim 0\$ for nearby systems. Assuming a Gaussian GC luminosity function, we compute that the completeness of the GC search is above 90 percent for most dwarf galaxies. We construct the 90 percent credible intervals/upper limits on the GC specific frequency \$S\_\{\textbackslash rm N\}\$ of the MW dwarf galaxies: \$12 {$<$} S\_\{\textbackslash rm N\} {$<$} 47\$ for Fornax, \$S\_\{\textbackslash rm N\} {$<$} 20\$ for the dwarfs with \$-12 {$<$} M\_\{\textbackslash rm V\} {$<$} -10\$, \$S\_\{\textbackslash rm N\} {$<$} 30\$ for the dwarfs with \$-10 {$<$} M\_\{\textbackslash rm V\} {$<$} -7\$, and \$S\_\{\textbackslash rm N\} {$<$} 90\$ for the dwarfs with \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm V\} {$>$} -7\$.

The images are then processed through the exact same neural network used to estimate SDSS morphologies to classify simulated galaxies in four morphological classes (E, S0/a, Sab, Scd). The CNN model classifies simulated galaxies in one of the four main classes with the same uncertainty as for observed galaxies. The mass-size relations of the simulated galaxies divided by morphological type also reproduce well the slope and the normalization of observed relations which confirms a reasonable diversity of optical morphologies in the TNG suite. However we find a weak correlation between optical morphology and Sersic index in the TNG suite as opposed to SDSS which might require further investigation. The stellar mass functions (SMFs) decomposed into different morphologies still show some discrepancies with observations especially at the high-mass end. We find an overabundance of late-type galaxies ({$\sim$} 50\{\{ per cent\}\} versus {$\sim$} 20\{\{ per cent\}\}) at the high-mass end [log(M*/M{$\odot$}) {$>$} 11] of the SMF as compared to observations according to the CNN classifications and a lack of S0 galaxies ({$\sim$} 20\{\{ per cent\}\} versus {$\sim$} 40\{\{ per cent\}\}) at intermediate masses.

  abstract = {\$Gaia\$ DR2 has provided an unprecedented wealth of information about the positions and motions of stars in our Galaxy, and has highlighted the degree of disequilibria in the disc. As we collect data over a wider area of the disc it becomes increasingly appealing to start analysing stellar actions and angles, which specifically label orbit space, instead of their current phase space location. Conceptually, while \$\textbackslash bar\{x\}\$ and \$\textbackslash bar\{v\}\$ tell us about the potential and local interactions, grouping in action puts together stars that have similar frequencies and hence similar responses to dynamical effects occurring over several orbits. Grouping in actions and angles refines this further to isolate stars which are travelling together through space and hence have shared histories. Mixing these coordinate systems can confuse the interpretation. For example, it has been suggested that by moving stars to their guiding radius, the Milky Way spiral structure is visible as ridge-like overdensities in the \$Gaia\$ data \textbackslash citep\{Khoperskov+19b\}. However, in this work, we show that these features are in fact the known kinematic moving groups, both in the \$L\_z-\textbackslash phi\$ and the \$v\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{R\}\}-v\_\{\textbackslash phi\}\$ planes. Using simulations we show how this distinction will become even more important as we move to a global view of the Milky Way. As an example, we show that the radial velocity wave seen in the Galactic disc in \$Gaia\$ and APOGEE should become stronger in the action-angle frame, and that it can be reproduced by transient spiral structure.},

  abstract = {Flares, energetic eruptions on the surfaces of stars, are an unmistakable manifestation of magnetically driven emission. Their occurrence rates and energy distributions trace stellar characteristics such as mass and age. But before flares can be used to constrain stellar properties, the flaring-age-mass relation requires proper calibration. This work sets out to quantify flaring activity of independently age-dated main sequence stars for a broad range of spectral types using optical light curves obtained by the Kepler satellite. Drawing from the complete K2 archive, we searched 3435 \$\textbackslash sim 80\$ day long light curves of 2111 open cluster members for flares using the open-source software packages K2SC to remove instrumental and astrophysical variability from K2 light curves, and AltaiPony to search and characterize the flare candidates. We confirmed a total of 3844 flares on high probability open cluster members with ages from zero age main sequence (Pleiades) to 3.6 Gyr (M67). We extended the mass range probed in the first study of this series to span from Sun-like stars to mid-M dwarfs. We added the Hyades (690 Myr) to the sample as a comparison cluster to Praesepe (750 Myr), the 2.6 Gyr old Ruprecht 147, and several hundred light curves from the late K2 Campaigns in the remaining clusters. The flare energy distribution was similar in the entire parameter space, following a power law relation with exponent \$\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash approx 1.84-2.39\$. The flaring rates declined with age, and declined faster for higher mass stars. We found evidence that a rapid decline in flaring activity occurred in M1-M2 dwarfs around Hyades/Praesepe age, when these stars spun down to rotation periods of about 10 days, while higher mass stars had already transitioned to lower flaring rates, and lower mass stars still resided in the saturated activity regime.

The robustness of the membership probabilities is demonstrated using independent membership criteria (lithium and parallax) in two of the youngest clusters. The addition of radial velocities improves membership discrimination over proper motion selection alone, especially in more distant clusters. The kinematically-selected nature of the membership lists, independent of photometry and chemistry, makes the catalogue a valuable resource for testing stellar evolutionary models and investigating the time evolution of various parameters.},

From 43211 observed targets, 13985 are identified as highly probable cluster members (\$P{$>$}0.9\$), with an average membership probability of 0.993. The addition of GES radial velocities successfully drives down the fraction of false positives and we achieve better levels of discrimination in most clusters over the use of astrometric data alone, especially those at larger distances.

  abstract = {Open clusters are groups of stars that form at the same time, making them an ideal laboratory to test theories of star formation, stellar evolution, and dynamics in the Milky Way disk. However, the utility of an open cluster can be limited by the accuracy and completeness of its known members. Here, we employ a "top-down" technique, \{\textbackslash it extreme deconvolution gaussian mixture models\} (XDGMM), to extract and evaluate known open clusters from Gaia DR2 by fitting the distribution of stellar parallax and proper motion along a line-of-sight. Extreme deconvolution techniques can recover the intrinsic distribution of astrometric quantities, accounting for the full covariance matrix of the errors; this allows open cluster members to be identified even when presented with relatively uncertain measurement data. To date, open cluster studies have only applied extreme deconvolution to specialized searches for individual systems. We use XDGMM to characterize the open clusters reported by Ahumada et al. 2007 and are able to recover 420 of the 426 open clusters therein (98.1\textbackslash\%). Our membership list contains the overwhelming majority (\${$>$}95\textbackslash\%\$) of previously known cluster members. We also identify a new, significant, and relatively faint cluster member population and validate their membership status using Gaia eDR3. We report the fortuitous discovery of 11 new open cluster candidates within the lines of sight we analyzed. We present our technique, its advantages and challenges, as well as publish our membership lists and updated cluster parameters.},

At the extreme, the value of diversity is under attack as a few, vocal academics use public forums to question the innate intellectual abilities of certain demographic groups. Throughout my career as an astronomer, from graduate student, through professor to department chair, I have witnessed these struggles firsthand. Exclusive cultures result in lost opportunities in the form of unfulfilled potential of all members of the institution - students, administrators and faculty alike. How to move steadily towards inclusion is an unsolved problem that hampers the advancement of knowledge itself. As every scientist knows, problem definition is an essential feature of problem solution. This article draws on insights from dynamical systems descriptions of conflict developed in the social and behavioral sciences to present a model that captures the convoluted, interacting challenges that stifle progress on this problem. This description of complexity explains the persistence of exclusive cultures and the inadequacy of quick or simple fixes. It also motivates the necessity of prolonged and multifaceted approaches to solutions. It is incumbent on our faculties to recognize the complexities in both problem and solutions, and persevere in responding to these intractable dynamics. It is incumbent on our administrations to provide the consistent structure that supports these tasks. It incumbent on all of our constituents - students, administration and faculty - to be cognizant of and responsive to these efforts.},

Considering it an almost complete sample of clusters within this distance, we performed a comprehensive statistical analysis of various cluster parameters such as spatial position, age, size, mass, and extinction.\emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}We find an average cluster scale height of \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{h{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 60 {$\pm$} 2 pc for clusters younger than 700 Myr, which increases to 64 {$\pm$} 2 pc when we include all the clusters. The \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{h{$<$}sub/{$>$} is found to be strongly dependent on \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{GC{$<$}sub/{$>$} and age, and on an average, \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{h{$<$}sub/{$>$} is more than twice as large as in the outer region than in the inner region of the solar circle, except for the youngest population of clusters. The solar offset is found to be 6.2 {$\pm$} 1.1 pc above the formal Galactic plane.

  abstract = {Many young and intermediate age massive stellar clusters host bimodal distributions in the rotation rates of their stellar populations, with a dominant peak of rapidly rotating stars and a secondary peak of slow rotators. The origin of this bimodal rotational distribution is currently debated and two main theories have been put forward in the literature. The first is that all/most stars are born as rapid rotators and that interacting binaries brake a fraction of the stars, resulting in two populations. The second is that the rotational distribution is a reflection of the early evolution of pre-main sequence stars, in particular, whether they are able to retain or lose their protoplanetary discs during the first few Myr. Here, we test the binary channel by exploiting multi-epoch VLT/MUSE observations of NGC 1850, a 100Myr massive cluster in the LMC, to search for differences in the binary fractions of the slow and fast rotating populations. If binarity is the cause of the rotational bimodality, we would expect that the slowly rotating population should have a much larger binary fraction than the rapid rotators. However, in our data we detect similar fractions of binary stars in the slow and rapidly rotating populations (5.9+/-1.1\% and 4.5+/-0.6\%, respectively).Hence, we conclude that binarity is not a dominant mechanism in the formation of the observed bimodal rotational distributions.},

  abstract = {The Galactic disk is expected to be spatially, kinematically, and chemically clustered on many scales due to both star formation and non-axisymmetries in the Galactic potential. In this work we calculate the spatial and kinematic two-point correlation functions using a sample of \$1.7 \textbackslash times 10\^6\$ stars within 1 kpc of the Sun with 6D phase space information available from \textbackslash textit\{Gaia\} DR2. Clustering is detected on spatial scales of 1-300 pc and velocity scales of at least 15 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$. With bound structures included, the data have a power-law index (\$\textbackslash xi(\textbackslash Delta r) \textbackslash propto \textbackslash Delta r\^\{\textbackslash gamma\}\$) of \$\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash approx-2\$ at most spatial scales, which is in line with theoretical predictions. After removing bound structures, the data have a power-law index of \$\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash approx-1\$ for \${$<$}100\$ pc and \$\textbackslash gamma \textbackslash lesssim -1.5\$ for \${$>$}100\$ pc. We interpret these results with the aid of a novel star-by-star simulation of the Galaxy in which stars are born in clusters orbiting in a realistic potential that includes spiral arms, a bar, and GMCs. We find that the simulation largely agrees with the observations (within a factor of 2-3) at all spatial and kinematic scales. In detail, the correlation function in the simulation is shallower than the data at \${$<$} 20\$ pc scales, and steeper than the data at \${$>$} 30\$ pc scales. We also find a persistent clustering signal in the kinematic correlation function for the data at large \$\textbackslash Delta v\$ (\${$>$}5\$ km s\$\^\{-1\}\$) not present in the simulations. We speculate that this mismatch between observations and simulations may be due to two processes not included in the simulation: hierarchical star formation and transient spiral arms. We also use the simulations to predict the clustering signal as a function of pair-wise metallicity and age separations. Ages and metallicities measured with a precision of \$50\textbackslash\%\$ and \$0.05\$ dex are required in order to enhance the clustering signal.},

  abstract = {The formation of star clusters involves the growth of smaller, gas-rich subclusters through accretion of gas from the giant molecular cloud within which the subclusters are embedded. The two main accretion mechanisms responsible for this are accretion of gas from dense filaments, and from the ambient background of the cloud. We perform simulations of both of these accretion processes onto gas-rich star clusters using coupled smoothed particle hydrodynamics to model the gas, and N-body dynamics to model the stars. We find that, for both accretion processes, the accreting star cluster loses some of its original mass while gaining mass from either the ambient background or the dense filament. The amount of mass lost from both these processes is small compared to the total mass of the cluster. However, in the case of accretion from a background medium, the net effect can be a decrease in the total mass of the cluster if it is travelling fast enough through the ambient medium (\${$>$} 4\$kms\$\^\{-1\}\$). We find that the amount of mass lost from the cluster through filamentary accretion is independent of the density, width, or number of filaments funneling gas into the cluster and is always such that the mass of the cluster is constantly increasing with time. We compare our results to idealized prescriptions used to model star cluster formation in larger scale GMC simulations and find that such prescriptions act as an upper limit when describing the mass of the star cluster they represent.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed study of NGC 6791, NGC 6811, NGC 6819 and NGC 6866, the four open clusters that are located in the Kepler prime field. We use new CCD UBV(RI)KC photometry, which was combined with Gaia EDR3 photometric/astrometric data, to derive the astrophysical parameters with two independent methods - one of them the fitCMD algorithm. Furthermore, we provide among others estimates of the mass and mass function, the cluster structure, derive the cluster orbits, and discuss the cluster dynamics. All objects belong to the older open cluster population (1-7Gyr), are in an advanced dynamical stage with signs of mass segregation, and are located close to the solar circle, but show a large range in respect of radii, member stars or observed cluster mass (100-2000 Msolar). For the three younger objects we were also able to provide photometric metallicity estimates, which confirms their status as clusters with a roughly solar metallicity. The most outstanding object is clearly NGC 6791, a very old cluster with a high metallicity at a distance of about 4.5 kpc from the Sun. We estimate a probable radial migration by about 7 kpc, resulting in a birth position close to the Galactic center.},

  abstract = {Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3) contains the second release of the combined radial velocities. It is based on the spectra collected during the first 34 months of the nominal mission. The longer time baseline and the improvements of the pipeline made it possible to push the processing limit, from Grvs = 12 in Gaia DR2, to Grvs = 14 mag. In this article, we describe the new functionalities implemented for Gaia DR3, the quality filters applied during processing and post-processing and the properties and performance of the published velocities. For Gaia DR3, several functionalities were upgraded or added. (Abridged) Gaia DR3 contains the combined radial velocities of 33 812 183 stars. With respect to Gaia DR2, the interval of temperature has been expanded from Teff \textbackslash in [3600, 6750] K to Teff \textbackslash in [3100, 14500] K for the bright stars ( Grvs \textbackslash leq 12 mag) and [3100, 6750] K for the fainter stars. The radial velocities sample a significant part of the Milky Way: they reach a few kilo-parsecs beyond the Galactic centre in the disc and up to about 10-15 kpc vertically into the inner halo. The median formal precision of the velocities is of 1.3 km/s at Grvs = 12 and 6.4 km/s at Grvs = 14 mag. The velocity zero point exhibits a small systematic trend with magnitude starting around Grvs = 11 mag and reaching about 400 m/s at Grvs = 14 mag. A correction formula is provided, which can be applied to the published data. The Gaia DR3 velocity scale is in satisfactory agreement with APOGEE, GALAH, GES and RAVE, with systematic differences that mostly do not exceed a few hundreds m/s. The properties of the radial velocities are also illustrated with specific objects: open clusters, globular clusters as well as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). For example, the precision of the data allows to map the line-of-sight rotational velocities of the globular cluster 47 Tuc and of the LMC.},

  abstract = {Metric learning aims to measure the similarity among samples while using an optimal distance metric for learning tasks. Metric learning methods, which generally use a linear projection, are limited in solving real-world problems demonstrating non-linear characteristics. Kernel approaches are utilized in metric learning to address this problem. In recent years, deep metric learning, which provides a better solution for nonlinear data through activation functions, has attracted researchers\&rsquo; attention in many different areas. This article aims to reveal the importance of deep metric learning and the problems dealt with in this field in the light of recent studies. As far as the research conducted in this field are concerned, most existing studies that are inspired by Siamese and Triplet networks are commonly used to correlate among samples while using shared weights in deep metric learning. The success of these networks is based on their capacity to understand the similarity relationship among samples. Moreover, sampling strategy, appropriate distance metric, and the structure of the network are the challenging factors for researchers to improve the performance of the network model. This article is considered to be important, as it is the first comprehensive study in which these factors are systematically analyzed and evaluated as a whole and supported by comparing the quantitative results of the methods.},

  abstract = {Globular clusters (GCs) are typically old, with most having formed at z {$>\sptilde$} 2. This makes understanding their birth environments difficult, as they are typically too distant to observe with sufficient angular resolution to resolve GC birth sites. Using 25 cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies from the E-MOSAICS project, with physically-motivated models for star formation, feedback, and the formation, evolution, and disruption of GCs, we identify the birth environments of present-day GCs. We find roughly half of GCs in these galaxies formed in-situ (52.0 +/- 1.0 per cent) between z \textasciitilde{} 2 - 4, in turbulent, high-pressure discs fed by gas that was accreted without ever being strongly heated through a virial shock or feedback. A minority of GCs form during mergers (12.6 +/- 0.6 per cent in major mergers, and 7.2 +/- 0.5 per cent in minor mergers), but we find that mergers are important for preserving the GCs seen today by ejecting them from their natal, high density interstellar medium (ISM), where proto-GCs are rapidly destroyed due to tidal shocks from ISM substructure. This chaotic history of hierarchical galaxy assembly acts to mix the spatial and kinematic distribution of GCs formed through different channels, making it difficult to use observable GC properties to distinguish GCs formed in mergers from ones formed by smooth accretion, and similarly GCs formed in-situ from those formed ex-situ. These results suggest a simple picture of GC formation, in which GCs are a natural outcome of normal star formation in the typical, gas-rich galaxies that are the progenitors of present-day galaxies.},

  abstract = {Young stellar associations hold a star formation record that can persist for millions of years, revealing the progression of star formation long after the dispersal of the natal cloud. To identify nearby young stellar populations that trace this progression, we have designed a comprehensive framework for the identification of young stars, and use it to identify \$\textbackslash sim\$3\$\textbackslash times 10\^4\$ candidate young stars within a distance of 333 pc using Gaia DR2. Applying the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to this sample, we identify 27 top-level groups, nearly half of which have little to no presence in previous literature. Ten of these groups have visible substructure, including notable young associations such as Orion, Perseus, Taurus, and Sco-Cen. We provide a complete subclustering analysis on all groups with substructure, using age estimates to reveal each region's star formation history. The patterns we reveal include an apparent star formation origin for Sco-Cen along a semicircular arc, as well as clear evidence for sequential star formation moving away from that arc with a propagation speed of \$\textbackslash sim\$4 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ (\$\textbackslash sim\$4 pc Myr\$\^\{-1\}\$). We also identify earlier bursts of star formation in Perseus and Taurus that predate current, kinematically identical active star-forming events, suggesting that the mechanisms that collect gas can spark multiple generations of star formation, punctuated by gas dispersal and cloud regrowth. The large spatial scales and long temporal scales on which we observe star formation offer a bridge between the processes within individual molecular clouds and the broad forces guiding star formation at galactic scales.},

From established member stars we derived spatial parameters (coordinates of centres and radii of the main morphological parts of clusters) and cluster kinematics (average proper motions and sometimes radial velocities).

In each passband the CLF shows a linear part covering a range of 6 to 7 mag at the bright end. The CLFs reach their maxima at an absolute magnitude of -2 mag, then drop by one order of magnitude. During cluster evolution, the CLF changes its slope within tight, but well-defined limits. The CLF of the youngest clusters has a steep slope of about 0.4 at bright magnitudes and a quasi-flat portion for faint clusters. For the oldest population, we find a flatter function with a slope of about 0.2. The CLFs at Galactocentric radii smaller than that of the solar circle differ from those in the direction of the Galactic anti-centre. The CLF in the inner area is flatter and the cluster surface density higher than the local one.

In this paper, we present a new real-bogus classifier based on a Bayesian convolutional neural network that provides nuanced, uncertainty-aware classification of transient candidates in difference imaging, and demonstrate its application to the datastream from the GOTO wide-field optical survey. Not only are candidates assigned a well-calibrated probability of being real, but also an associated confidence that can be used to prioritise human vetting efforts and inform future model optimisation via active learning. To fully realise the potential of this architecture, we present a fully-automated training set generation method which requires no human labelling, incorporating a novel data-driven augmentation method to significantly improve the recovery of faint and nuclear transient sources. We achieve competitive classification accuracy (FPR and FNR both below 1\%) compared against classifiers trained with fully human-labelled datasets, whilst being significantly quicker and less labour-intensive to build. This data-driven approach is uniquely scalable to the upcoming challenges and data needs of next-generation transient surveys.

The escape rate from a cluster depends on the number of stars and the strength of the tidal force field; when expressed in this way it is almost independent of core radius or central concentration.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

Additionally, we explore a connection with dropout: Gaussian dropout objectives correspond to SGVB with local reparameterization, a scale-invariant prior and proportionally fixed posterior variance. Our method allows inference of more flexibly parameterized posteriors; specifically, we propose variational dropout, a generalization of Gaussian dropout where the dropout rates are learned, often leading to better models. The method is demonstrated through several experiments.},

  abstract = {Sparse open clusters can be found at high galactic latitudes where loosely populated clusters are more easily detected against the lower stellar background. Because most star formation takes place in the thin disc, the observed population of clusters far from the Galactic plane is hard to explain. We combined spectral parameters from the GALAH survey with the Gaia DR2 catalogue to study the dynamics and chemistry of five old sparse high-latitude clusters in more detail. We find that four of them (NGC 1252, NGC 6994, NGC 7772, NGC 7826) - originally classified in 1888 - are not clusters but are instead chance projections on the sky. Member stars quoted in the literature for these four clusters are unrelated in our multidimensional physical parameter space; the quoted cluster properties in the literature are therefore meaningless. We confirm the existence of visually similar NGC 1901 for which we provide a probabilistic membership analysis. An overdensity in three spatial dimensions proves to be enough to reliably detect sparse clusters, but the whole six-dimensional space must be used to identify members with high confidence, as demonstrated in the case of NGC 1901.},

  abstract = {Gaia DR2 provides unprecedented precision in measurements of the distance and kinematics of stars in the solar neighborhood. Through applying unsupervised machine learning on DR2's 5D data set (3D position + 2D velocity), we identify a number of clusters, associations, and comoving groups within 1 kpc and (many of which have not been previously known). We estimate their ages with the precision of {$\sim$}0.15 dex. Many of these groups appear to be filamentary or string-like, oriented in parallel to the Galactic plane, and some span hundreds of parsec in length. Most of these string lack a central cluster, indicating that their filamentary structure is primordial, rather than the result of tidal stripping or dynamical processing. The youngest strings ({$<$}100 Myr) are orthogonal to the Local Arm. The older ones appear to be remnants of several other arm-like structures that cannot be presently traced by dust and gas. The velocity dispersion measured from the ensemble of groups and strings increase with age, suggesting a timescale for dynamical heating of {$\sim$}300 Myr. This timescale is also consistent with the age at which the population of strings begins to decline, while the population in more compact groups continues to increase, suggesting that dynamical processes are disrupting the weakly bound string populations, leaving only individual clusters to be identified at the oldest ages. These data shed a new light on the local galactic structure and a large-scale cloud collapse.},

The current paper builds on the sample from the previous work, extending it in distance from 1 kpc to 3 kpc, increasing the number of identified structures up to 8292. To aid in the analysis of the population properties, we developed a neural network called Auriga to robustly estimate the age, extinction, and distance of a stellar group based on the input photometry and parallaxes of the individual members. We apply Auriga to derive the properties of not only the structures found in this paper, but also previously identified open clusters. Through this work, we examine the temporal structure of the spiral arms. Specifically, we find that the Sagittarius arm has moved by {$>$}500 pc in the last 100 Myr, and the Perseus arm has been experiencing a relative lull in star formation activity over the last 25 Myr. We confirm the findings from the previous paper on the transient nature of the spiral arms, with the timescale of transition of a few 100 Myr. Finally, we find a peculiar \textasciitilde 1 Gyr old stream of stars that appears to be heliocentric. It is unclear what is the origin of it.},

The most reliable cluster members are selected with our traditional method modified for the use of Gaia DR2 data. Numerical simulations use the integration of cluster trajectories backwards in time with our original high order Hermite4 code \textbackslash PGRAPE. We constrain the age, spatial coordinates and velocities, radii and masses of the clusters. We estimate the actual separation of the cluster centres equal to 24 pc. The orbital integration shows that the clusters were much closer in the past if their current line-of-sight velocities are very similar and the total mass is more than 7 times larger the mass of the determined most reliable members. We conclude that the two clusters Cr 135 and UBC 7 might very well have formed a physial pair, based on the observational evidence as well as numerical simulations.

In the most compact regions, stellar feedback is least effective in removing the gas and stars may form very efficiently. These are also the regions where, in high-mass clusters, ejecta from some kind of high-mass stars are effectively captured during the formation phase of some of the low mass stars and effectively channeled into the latter to form multiple populations. Star formation epochs in star clusters are generally set by gas flows that determine the abundance of gas in the cluster. We argue that there is likely only one star formation epoch after which clusters remain essentially clear of gas by cluster winds. Collisional dynamics is important in this phase leading to core collapse, expansion and eventual dispersion of every cluster. We review recent developments in the field with a focus on theoretical work.},

  abstract = {Two generations of stars, G1 and G2, typically populate Galactic globular clusters (GCs). The origin of G2 stars is unclear. We uncover two empirical dependencies between GC characteristics, which can be explained by the formation of G2 Main-Sequence (MS) stars due to collision\textbackslash merging of their primordial counterparts (G1). A similar genesis of both G2 stars and peculiar objects like low-mass X-ray binaries and millisecond pulsars is also implied. Indeed, we find a significant (at a confidence level {$>$} 99,9\%) anti-correlation between the fraction of G1 red giants (N\_\{G1\}/N\_\{tot\}) and stellar encounter rates among 51 GCs. Moreover, a Milky Way-like initial mass function (IMF) requires a large fraction of MS stars with masses M\_ms {$<$} 0.5 M\_sun, more specifically at least \textasciitilde 50\% with [0.1-0.5] M\_sun. Unlike cluster mass loss, stellar collisions\textbackslash merging retain these G1 stars by converting them into more massive G2 ones, with mainly M\_ms {$>$} 0.5 M\_sun. This process coupled with a decreasing relative mass loss with increasing GC masses implies a smaller (N\_\{G1\}/N\_\{tot\}) in more massive GCs with a shallower present day MF. From data for 35 GCs, we find that such an anti-correlation is significant at 98.3\% confidence level (Spearman's correlation) for 12 most massive GCs (M\_GC {$>$} 10\^\{5.3\} M\_sun) and it is at a confidence level of 89\textbackslash\% for the 12 least massive GCs (M\_GC {$<$} 10\^\{5.1\} M\_sun). Other fractions of G1 and G2 stars observed at the bottom of the MS as compared with the red giant branch in a few GCs are consistent with the scenario proposed here.},

The overall spatial structure and distribution of cluster member stars in the colour-magnitude diagram were recovered under a broad variety of conditions. For a set of 360 simulations, the resulting true positive rates (a measurement of purity) and member recovery rates (a measurement of completeness) at the 90\% membership probability level reached high values for a range of open cluster ages (10\textsuperscript{7.1} - 10\textsuperscript{9.5} yr), initial masses (0.5 - 10 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{3}M\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}) and heliocentric distances (0.5 - 4.0 kpc). UPMASK was also tested on real data from the fields of open cluster Haffner 16 and of the closely projected clusters Haffner 10 and Czernik 29. These tests showed that even for moderate variable extinction and cluster superposition, the method yielded useful cluster membership probabilities and provided some insight into their stellar contents. The UPMASK implementation will be available at the CRAN archive.},

  abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5Msolar and near 0.08Msolar. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices {$\alpha$} are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by {$\Delta\alpha\sptilde$}0.5 between 0.1 and 1Msolar than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto \& Zoccali; Paresce \& De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M\'endez \& Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

While forming, they can be distinguished observationally from unbound star formation by their high densities, virialised velocity structures, and star formation histories that accelerate toward the present, but extend multiple free-fall times into the past. In this paper we examine several proposed scenarios for how such structures might form and evolve, and carry out a Bayesian analysis to test these models against observed distributions of protostellar age, counts of young stellar objects relative to gas, and the overall star formation rate of the Milky Way. We show that models in which the acceleration of star formation is due either to a large-scale collapse or a time-dependent increase in star formation efficiency are unable to satisfy the combined set of observational constraints. In contrast, models in which clusters form in a "conveyor belt" mode where gas accretion and star formation occur simultaneously, but the star formation rate per free-fall time is low, can match the observations.},

Proper motions from Gaia DR2 reveal that at least 75\% of these systems are expanding; however, rotation is only detected in one system. Typical expansion velocities are on the order of {$\sim$}0.5 km s-1, and in several systems, there is a positive radial gradient in expansion velocity. Systems that are still embedded in molecular clouds are less likely to be expanding than those that are partially or fully revealed. One-dimensional velocity dispersions, which range from \{{$\sigma$} \}1\{\{D\}\}=1 to 3 km s-1, imply that most of the stellar systems in our sample are supervirial and that some are unbound. In star-forming regions that contain multiple clusters or subclusters, we find no evidence that these groups are coalescing, implying that hierarchical cluster assembly, if it occurs, must happen rapidly during the embedded stage.},

  abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within 2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70-90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

  abstract = {We describe a population of young star clusters (SCs) formed in a hydrodynamical simulation of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy merger resolved with individual massive stars at sub-parsec spatial resolution. The simulation is part of the GRIFFIN (Galaxy Realizations Including Feedback From INdividual massive stars) project. The star formation environment during the simulation spans seven orders of magnitude in gas surface density and thermal pressure, and the global star formation rate surface density (\$\textbackslash Sigma\_\textbackslash mathrm\{SFR\}\$) varies by more than three orders of magnitude during the simulation. Young SCs more massive than \$M\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{*,cl\}\}\textbackslash sim 10\^\{2.5\}\textbackslash,M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ form along a mass function with a power-law index \$\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash sim-1.7\$ (\$\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash sim-2\$ for \$M\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{*,cl\}\}\textbackslash gtrsim10\^\{3\}\textbackslash,M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) at all merger phases, while the normalization and the highest SC masses (up to \$\textbackslash sim 10\^6 M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) correlate with \$\textbackslash Sigma\_\textbackslash mathrm\{SFR\}\$. The cluster formation efficiency varies from \$\textbackslash Gamma\textbackslash sim20\textbackslash\%\$ in early merger phases to \$\textbackslash Gamma\textbackslash sim80\textbackslash\%\$ at the peak of the starburst and is compared to observations and model predictions. The massive SCs (\$\textbackslash gtrsim10\^4\textbackslash,M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) have sizes and mean surface densities similar to observed young massive SCs. Simulated lower mass clusters appear slightly more concentrated than observed. All SCs form on timescales of a few Myr and lose their gas rapidly resulting in typical stellar age spreads between \$\textbackslash sigma\textbackslash sim0.1-2\$ Myr (\$1\textbackslash sigma\$), consistent with observations. The age spreads increase with cluster mass, with the most massive cluster (\$\textbackslash sim10\^6\textbackslash, M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) reaching a spread of \$5\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{Myr\}\$ once its hierarchical formation finishes. Our study shows that it is now feasible to investigate the SC population of entire galaxies with novel high-resolution numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {Pop II stars formed a few hundred million years after the Big Bang were key drivers of cosmic reionization and building blocks of high redshift galaxies. How and when these stars formed is a subject of ongoing research. We conduct cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the formation of Pop II star clusters in dark matter halos forming at \$z=10-25\$ in the aftermath of a pair instability supernova (PISN). Our simulations model the formation of Pop III and Pop II stars in a self-consistent manner along with their radiative, chemical and SN feedback in halos of \$\textbackslash rm 5 \textbackslash times 10\^5- 7 \textbackslash times 10\^7\textasciitilde M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. We find that a PISN evacuates the gas from halos \$\textbackslash rm \textbackslash leq 3 \textbackslash times 10\^\{6\}\textasciitilde M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and thereafter shuts off in situ star formation for at-least 30 Myr. Pop II stellar clusters of \$\textbackslash rm 923\textasciitilde M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and \$\textbackslash rm 6800\textasciitilde M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ form in halos of \$\textbackslash rm 3.5 \textbackslash times 10\^7\textasciitilde M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and \$\textbackslash rm 7.2 \textbackslash times 10\^7\textasciitilde M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, respectively. The mode of star formation is highly episodic and mainly regulated by Pop II SN feedback. The average star formation rates are \$\textbackslash rm 10\^\{-5\}-10\^\{-4\}\textasciitilde M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}/yr\$ and the star formation efficiency is less than 1\textbackslash\%.},

  abstract = {The majority of Galactic globular clusters (GCs) contain multiple stellar populations displaying specific chemical abundance variations. In particular, GCs generally contain a `primordial' population with abundances similar to field stars, along with an `enriched' population exhibiting light element anomalies. In this paper we present a homogeneous and wide-view analysis of multiple stellar populations in 28 Galactic GCs. By using a combination of HST photometry together with wide-field, ground-based photometry we are able to analyse between 84\% and 99\% of all stars in each cluster. For each GC, we classify stars into separate sub-populations using the well-established \$C\_\{\textbackslash rm\{UBI\}\}\$ colour index, and investigate the spatial distributions of these populations. Our results show that dynamically young GCs can contain either centrally concentrated enriched or primordial populations, or no centrally concentrated population. Dynamically old GCs show fully mixed populations as expected. The existence of clusters born with centrally concentrated primordial (and homogeneously mixed) populations exacerbates the mass-budget problem facing many cluster formation scenarios. The diversity in these results also highlights the need for additional theories that can account for the wide variety of initial conditions that we find. We finally investigate the enriched star fraction as a function of different global parameters in our GC sample, using also data for young and low-mass clusters from the Small- and Large Magellanic Clouds and confirm earlier results that the enriched star fraction strongly correlates with the initial mass of a cluster.},

  abstract = {Deep learning with artificial neural networks is increasingly gaining attention because of its potential for data-driven astronomy. However, this methodology usually does not provide uncertainties and does not deal with incompleteness and noise in the training data. In this work, we design a neural network for high-resolution spectroscopic analysis using APO Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) data that mimics the methodology of standard spectroscopic analyses: stellar parameters are determined using the full wavelength range, but individual element abundances use censored portions of the spectrum. We train this network with a customized objective function that deals with incomplete and noisy training data and apply dropout variational inference to derive uncertainties on our predictions. We determine parameters and abundances for 18 individual elements at the \{{$\approx$} \} 0.03 dex level, even at low signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate that the uncertainties returned by our method are a realistic estimate of the precision and they automatically blow up when inputs or outputs outside of the training set are encountered, thus shielding users from unwanted extrapolation. By using standard deep-learning tools for GPU acceleration, our method is extremely fast, allowing analysis of the entire APOGEE data set of {$\approx$}250 000 spectra in 10 min on a single, low-cost GPU. We release the stellar parameters and 18 individual-element abundances with associated uncertainty for the entire APOGEE DR14 data set. Simultaneously, we release astroNN, a well-tested, open-source PYTHON package developed for this work, but that is also designed to be a general package for deep learning in astronomy. astroNN is available at https://github.com/henrysky/astroNN with extensive documentation at http://astroNN.readthedocs.io.},

The CMDs are fitted in considerable detail to ensure the reliability of property parameters of clusters.

  abstract = {It is well known that there are few open clusters (OCs) in the high-latitude region of the Milky Way galaxy, because most star formation takes place in the thin disk. It is therefore crucial to look for high Galactic latitude OCs, in order to understand OCs and the Galactic parts outside the plane well. This work looks for high Galactic latitude OCs in Gaia Early Data Release 3, and determines their basic parameters from color\textendash magnitude diagrams (CMDs) if the main sequence is included in CMDs. The friend-of-friend method is applied to the determination of the membership of stars. Star groups with more than 20 bright (G {$<$} 18 mag) stars are taken as OC candidates, and these candidates are finally verified by the observed CMDs including stars fainter than 18 mag in the G band. After crossmatching with previous catalogs, 56 new OC candidates are found in the high Galactic latitude region with {$\mid$}b{$\mid$} {$\geq$} 25\textdegree, in which 35 have somewhat clear CMDs and are suggested as newly discovered OCs. Finally, eight of the new OCs are confirmed again by the pyUPMASK technique. The new sample increases the total number of known high Galactic latitude OC candidates significantly. The distance modulus, color excess, metallicity, age, and binary fraction of 35 newly discovered OCs are determined by fitting their observed CMDs to the ASPS stellar population models.

  abstract = {The binary properties of open clusters place crucial constraints on star formation theory and clusters' dynamical evolution. We develop a comprehensive approach that models the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of the cluster members as the mixture of single stars and photometric unresolved binaries. This method enables us to infer the binary properties, including the binary fraction \$f\_\textbackslash mathrm\{b\}\$ and binary mass-ratio distribution index \$\textbackslash gamma\_q\$ when a power-law is assumed, with high accuracy and precision, which were unfeasible in conventional methods. We employ a modified Gaussian process to determine the main sequence ridge line and its scatter from the observed CMD as model input. As a first example, we apply the method to the open cluster NGC3532 with the Gaia DR2 photometry. For the cluster members within a magnitude range corresponding to FGK dwarfs, we obtain \$f\_\textbackslash mathrm\{b\} = 0.267\textbackslash pm0.019\$ and \$\textbackslash gamma\_q = - 0.10\textbackslash pm0.22\$ for binaries with mass ratio \$q {$>$} 0.2\$. The \$f\_\textbackslash mathrm\{b\}\$ value is consistent with the previous work on NGC3532 and smaller than that of field stars. The close to zero \$\textbackslash gamma\_q\$ indicates that the mass ratios of binaries follow a nearly uniform distribution. For the first time, we unveil that the stars with smaller mass or in the inner region tend to have lower \$f\_\textbackslash mathrm\{b\}\$ and more positive value of \$\textbackslash gamma\_q\$ due to the lack of low mass-ratio binaries. The clear dependences of binary properties on mass and radius are most likely caused by the internal dynamics.},

We find that the northern part of Orion A, including regions ONC-OMC-1, OMC-2, OMC-3 and OMC-4, shows qualitative agreements with the cloud-cloud collision scenario, while in one of the southern regions, NGC1999, there is no indication of such a process in causing the birth of new stars. On the other hand, another southern cluster, L1641N, shows slight tendencies of cloud-cloud collision. Overall, our results support the cloud-cloud collision process as being an important mechanism for star cluster formation in Orion A.},

  abstract = {We propose a new model of Bayesian neural networks to not only detect the events of compact binary coalescence in the observational data of gravitational waves (GW) but also identify the full length of the event duration including the inspiral stage. This is achieved by incorporating the Bayesian approach into the convolutional, long short-term memory, fully connected deep neural network classifier, which integrates together the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM). Our model successfully detect all seven binary black hole events in the LIGO Livingston O2 data, with the periods of their GW waveforms correctly labeled. The ability of a Bayesian approach for uncertainty estimation enables a newly defined `awareness' state for recognizing the possible presence of signals of unknown types, which is otherwise rejected in a non-Bayesian model. Such data chunks labeled with the awareness state can then be further investigated rather than overlooked. Performance tests with 40,960 training samples against 512 chunks of 8-second real noise mixed with mock signals of various optimal signal-to-noise ratio 0 {$\leq\rho$}opt{$\leq$}18 show that our model recognizes 90\% of the events when {$\rho$}opt{$>$}7 (100\% when {$\rho$}opt{$>$}8.5 ) and successfully labels more than 95\% of the waveform periods when {$\rho$}opt{$>$}8 . The latency between the arrival of peak signal and generating an alert with the associated waveform period labeled is only about 20 seconds for an unoptimized code on a moderate GPU-equipped personal computer. This makes our model possible for nearly real-time detection and for forecasting the coalescence events when assisted with deeper training on a larger dataset using the state-of-art HPCs.},

Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase. Aims: We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task. Methods: Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion. Results: For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G {$<$} 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat G = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr-1, respectively.The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr-1. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr-1 in proper motion are seen on small ({$<$} 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and information for the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.},

The processing broadly followed the same procedures as for Gaia DR2, but with significant improvements to the modelling of observations. For the first time in the Gaia data processing, colour-dependent calibrations of the line- and point-spread functions have been used for sources with well-determined colours from DR2. In the astrometric processing these sources obtained five-parameter solutions, whereas other sources were processed using a special calibration that allowed a pseudocolour to be estimated as the sixth astrometric parameter. Compared with DR2, the astrometric calibration models have been extended, and the spin-related distortion model includes a self-consistent determination of basic-angle variations, improving the global parallax zero point. Gaia EDR3 gives full astrometric data (positions at epoch J2016.0, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1.468 billion sources (585 million with five-parameter solutions, 882 million with six parameters), and mean positions at J2016.0 for an additional 344 million. Solutions with five parameters are generally more accurate than six-parameter solutions, and are available for 93\% of the sources brighter than G = 17 mag. The median uncertainty in parallax and annual proper motion is 0.02-0.03 mas at magnitude G = 9 to 14, and around 0.5 mas at G = 20. Extensive characterisation of the statistical properties of the solutions is provided, including the estimated angular power spectrum of parallax bias from the quasars.},

  abstract = {Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) gives trigonometric parallaxes for nearly 1.5 billion sources. Inspection of the EDR3 data for sources identified as quasars reveals that their parallaxes are biased, that is systematically offset from the expected distribution around zero, by a few tens of microarcsec. We attempt to map the main dependencies of the parallax bias in EDR3. In principle this could provide a recipe for correcting the EDR3 parallaxes. For faint sources the quasars provide the most direct way to estimate parallax bias. In order to extend this to brighter sources and a broader range of colours, we use differential methods based on physical pairs (binaries) and sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The functional forms of the dependencies are explored by mapping the systematic differences between EDR3 and DR2 parallaxes. The parallax bias is found to depend in a non-trivial way on (at least) the magnitude, colour, and ecliptic latitude of the source. Different dependencies apply to the five- and six-parameter solutions in EDR3. While it is not possible to derive a definitive recipe for the parallax correction, we give tentative expressions to be used at the researcher's discretion and point out some possible paths towards future improvements.},

A Friend of Friend based cluster finder method is used to identify star clusters using 5-dimensional stellar parameters, \$l, b, \textbackslash varpi, \textbackslash mu\_\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash cos\textbackslash delta\$, and \$\textbackslash mu\_\textbackslash delta\$. Our new catalog contains 2443 star cluster candidates identified from disk stars located within \$|b|=25\^\textbackslash circ\$ and with \$G{$<$}18\$ mag. An automatic isochrone fitting scheme is applied to all cluster candidates. With a combination of parameters obtained from isochrone fitting, we classify cluster candidates into three classes (Class 1, 2 and 3). Class 1 clusters are the most probable star cluster candidates with the most stringent criteria. Most of these clusters are nearby (within 4 kpc). Our catalog is cross-matched with three Galactic star cluster catalogs, Kharchenko et al. (2013), Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2018, 2019), and Bica et al. (2019). The proper motion and parallax of matched star clusters are in good agreement with these earlier catalogs. We discover 76 new star cluster candidates that are not listed in these 3 catalogs. The majority of these are clusters older than log(age/yr)=8.0, and are located in the inner disk with \$|b|{$<$}5\^\textbackslash circ\$. The recent discovery of new star clusters suggests that current Galactic star cluster catalogs are still incomplete. Among the Class 1 cluster candidates, we find 56 candidates for star cluster groups. The pipeline, the catalog and the member list containing all candidates star clusters and star cluster groups have been made publicly available.},

Some studies have suggested an abrupt drop-off of the stellar density of the disk at Galactocentric distances R {$\greaterequivlnt$} 15 kpc, which means that in practice no disk stars or only very few of them should be found beyond this limit. However, stars in the Milky Way plane are detected at larger distances. In addition to the halo component, star counts have placed the end of the disk beyond 20 kpc, although this has not been spectroscopically confirmed so far. Aims: Here, we aim to spectroscopically confirm the presence of the disk stars up to much larger distances. Methods: With data from the LAMOST and SDSS-APOGEE spectroscopic surveys, we statistically derived the maximum distance at which the metallicity distribution of stars in the Galactic plane is distinct from that of the halo populations. Results: Our analysis reveals the presence of disk stars at R {$>$} 26 kpc (99.7\% C.L.) and even at R {$>$} 31 kpc (95.4\% C.L.).},

We present new measurements of the global properties of this cluster, including the initial mass function (IMF), age, and cluster mass. These results are based on Keck laser-guide-star adaptive optics observations used to identify the young stars and measure their Kp-band luminosity function as presented in Do et al. A Bayesian inference methodology is developed to simultaneously fit the global properties of the cluster utilizing the observations and extensive simulations of synthetic star clusters. We find that the slope of the mass function for this cluster is {$\alpha$} = 1.7 {$\pm$} 0.2, which is steeper than previously reported, but still flatter than the traditional Salpeter slope of 2.35. The age of the cluster is between 2.5 and 5.8 Myr with 95\% confidence, which is a younger age than typically adopted but consistent within the uncertainties of past measurements. The exact age of the cluster is difficult to determine since our results show two distinct age solutions (3.9 Myr and 2.8 Myr) due to model degeneracies in the relative number of Wolf\textendash Rayet and OB stars. The total cluster mass is between 14,000 and 37,000 M{$\Sun$} above 1 M{$\Sun$} and it is necessary to include multiple star systems in order to fit the observed luminosity function and the number of observed Wolf\textendash Rayet stars. The new IMF slope measurement is now consistent with X-ray observations indicating a factor of 10 fewer X-ray emitting pre-main-sequence stars than expected when compared with a Salpeter IMF. The young cluster at the Galactic center is one of the few definitive examples of an IMF that deviates significantly from the near-universal IMFs found in the solar neighborhood.},

With ever improving data, numerous kinematic "moving groups" of stars have been better characterized and new ones continue to be discovered. Here we present an improved method for detecting these groups using MGwave, a new open-source 2D wavelet transformation code that we have developed. Our code implements similar techniques to previous wavelet software; however, we include a more robust significance methodology and also allow for the investigation of underdensities which can eventually provide further information about the MW's non-axisymmetric features. Applying MGwave to the latest data release from Gaia (DR3), we detect 45 groups of stars with coherent velocities. We reproduce the majority of the previously detected moving groups in addition to identifying four additional significant candidates: one near Antoja12-GCSIII-13, one near GMG 5, and two with very low \$V\_r\$ and similar \$V\_\textbackslash phi\$ to Hercules. Finally, we have followed these associations of stars beyond the solar neighborhood, from Galactocentric radius of 6.5 to 10\textasciitilde kpc. Most detected groups are extended throughout radius indicating that they are streams of stars possibly due to non-axisymmetric features of the MW.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} The second \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} data release (\emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2) provides precise five-parameter astrometric data (positions, proper motions, and parallaxes) for an unprecedented number of sources (more than 1.3 billion, mostly stars). This new wealth of data will enable the undertaking of statistical analysis of many astrophysical problems that were previously infeasible for lack of reliable astrometry, and in particular because of the lack of parallaxes. However, the use of this wealth of astrometric data comes with a specific challenge: how can the astrophysical parameters of interest be properly inferred from these data?\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} The main focus of this paper, but not the only focus, is the issue of the estimation of distances from parallaxes, possibly combined with other information. We start with a critical review of the methods traditionally used to obtain distances from parallaxes and their shortcomings. Then we provide guidelines on how to use parallaxes more efficiently to estimate distances by using Bayesian methods. In particular we also show that negative parallaxes, or parallaxes with relatively large uncertainties still contain valuable information. Finally, we provide examples that show more generally how to use astrometric data for parameter estimation, including the combination of proper motions and parallaxes and the handling of covariances in the uncertainties.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The paper contains examples based on simulated \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} data to illustrate the problems and the solutions proposed. Furthermore, the developments and methods proposed in the paper are linked to a set of tutorials included in the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} archive documentation that provide practical examples and a good starting point for the application of the recommendations to actual problems. In all cases the source code for the analysis methods is provided.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our main recommendation is to always treat the derivation of (astro-)physical parameters from astrometric data, in particular when parallaxes are involved, as an inference problem which should preferably be handled with a full Bayesian approach.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} will provide fundamental data for many fields of astronomy. Further data releases will provide more data, and more precise data. Nevertheless, to fully use the potential it will always be necessary to pay careful attention to the statistical treatment of parallaxes and proper motions. The purpose of this paper is to help astronomers find the correct approach.}}}}}}}}}}},

Compared to previous releases, the main novelties and improvements are use of new TP-AGB tracks and related atmosphere models and spectra for M and C-type stars; inclusion of the surface H+He+CNO abundances in the isochrone tables, accounting for the effects of diffusion, dredge-up episodes and hot-bottom burning; inclusion of complete thermal pulse cycles, with a complete description of the in-cycle changes in the stellar parameters; new pulsation models to describe the long-period variability in the fundamental and first-overtone modes; and new dust models that follow the growth of the grains during the AGB evolution, in combination with radiative transfer calculations for the reprocessing of the photospheric emission. Overall, these improvements are expected to lead to a more consistent and detailed description of properties of TP-AGB stars expected in resolved stellar populations, especially in regard to their mean photometric properties from optical to mid-infrared wavelengths. We illustrate the expected numbers of TP-AGB stars of different types in stellar populations covering a wide range of ages and initial metallicities, providing further details on the ``C-star island'' that appears at intermediate values of age and metallicity, and about the AGB-boosting effect that occurs at ages close to 1.6-Gyr for populations of all metallicities.

By using photometry in ultraviolet and optical bands we discovered that the nearby young cluster NGC 6705 (M11) exhibits an extended main-sequence turnoff (eMSTO) and a broadened main sequence (MS). This is the first evidence of multiple stellar populations in a Galactic open cluster. By using high-resolution Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectra we provide direct evidence that the multiple sequences along the CMD correspond to stellar populations with different rotation rates. Specifically, the blue MS (bMS) is formed of slow-rotating stars, while red-MS (rMS) stars are fast rotators. Moreover, we exploit photometry from Gaia data release 2 (DR2) to show that three Galactic open clusters, namely NGC 2099, NGC 2360, and NGC 2818, exhibit the eMSTO, thus suggesting that it is a common feature among these objects. Our previous work on the Large Magellanic Cloud star cluster NGC 1818 shows that slowly and rapidly rotating stars populate the bMS and rMS observed in its CMD. The similarities between M11 and the young clusters of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) suggest that rotation is responsible for the appearance of multiple populations in the CMDs of both Milky Way open clusters and MCs young clusters.},

  abstract = {We study the response of star clusters to individual tidal perturbations using controlled \$N\$-body simulations. We consider perturbations by a moving point mass and by a disc, and vary the duration of the perturbation as well as the cluster density profile. For fast perturbations (i.e. `shocks'), the cluster gains energy in agreement with theoretical predictions in the impulsive limit. For slow disc perturbations, the energy gain is lower, and this has previously been attributed to adiabatic damping. However, the energy gain due to slow perturbations by a point-mass is similar to that due to fast shocks, which is not expected because adiabatic damping should be almost independent of the nature of the tides. We show that the geometric distortion of the cluster during slow perturbations is of comparable importance for the energy gain as adiabatic damping, and that the combined effect can qualitatively explain the results. The half-mass radius of the bound stars after a shock increases up to \$\textbackslash sim\$7\textbackslash\% for low-concentration clusters, and decreases \$\textbackslash sim\$3\textbackslash\% for the most concentrated ones. The fractional mass loss is a non-linear function of the energy gain, and depends on the nature of the tides and most strongly on the cluster density profile, making semi-analytic model predictions for cluster lifetimes extremely sensitive to the adopted density profile.},

  abstract = {Ancient (\${$>\$$}10 Gyr) globular clusters (GCs) show chemical abundance variations in the form of patterns among certain elements, e.g. N correlates with Na and anti-correlates with O. Recently, N abundance spreads have also been observed in massive star clusters that are significantly younger than old GCs, down to an age of \$\textbackslash sim\$2 Gyr. However, so far N has been the only element found to vary in such young objects. We report here the presence of Na abundance variations in the intermediate age massive star clusters NGC 416 (\$\textbackslash sim\$6.5 Gyr old) and Lindsay 1 (\$\textbackslash sim\$7.5 Gyr old) in the Small Magellanic Cloud, by combining HST and ESO-VLT MUSE observations. Using HST photometry we were able to construct ''chromosome maps'' and separate sub-populations with different N content, in the red giant branch of each cluster. MUSE spectra of individual stars belonging to each population were combined, resulting in high signal-to-noise spectra representative of each population, which were compared to search for mean differences in Na. We find a mean abundance variation of \$\textbackslash Delta\$[Na/Fe]\$=0.18\textbackslash pm0.04\$ dex for NGC 416 and \$\textbackslash Delta\$[Na/Fe]\$=0.24\textbackslash pm0.05\$ dex for Lindsay 1. In both clusters we find that the population that is enhanced in N is also enhanced in Na, which is the same pattern to the one observed in ancient GCs. Furthermore, we detect a bimodal distribution of core-helium burning Red Clump (RC) giants in the UV colour magnitude diagram of NGC 416. A comparison of the stacked MUSE spectra of the two RCs shows the same mean Na abundance difference between the two populations. The results reported in this work are a crucial hint that star clusters of a large age range share the same origin: they are the same types of objects, but only separated in age.},

Our data come from archival astrometric data from fine guidance sensor (FGS) 3 and newer data for three Hyads from FGS 1r, both white-light interferometers on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We obtain member parallaxes from six individual FGS fields and use the field containing van Altena 622 and van Altena 627 (= HIP 21138) as an example. Proper motions, spectral classifications, and VJHK photometry of the stars comprising the astrometric reference frames provide spectrophotometric estimates of reference star absolute parallaxes. Introducing these into our model as observations with error, we determine absolute parallaxes for each Hyad. The parallax of vA 627 is significantly improved by including a perturbation orbit for this previously known spectroscopic binary, now an astrometric binary. Compared to our original (1997) determinations, a combination of new data, updated calibration, and improved analysis lowered the individual parallax errors by an average factor of 4.5. Comparing parallaxes of the four stars contained in the Hipparcos catalog, we obtain an average factor of 11 times improvement with the HST. With these new results, we also have better agreement with Hipparcos for the four stars in common. These new parallaxes provide an average distance for these seven members, langDrang = 47.5 pc, for the core, a {$\pm$}1{$\sigma$} dispersion depth of 3.6 pc, and a minimum depth from individual components of 16.0 {$\pm$} 0.9 pc. Absolute magnitudes for each member are compared to established main sequences with excellent agreement. We obtain a weighted average distance modulus for the core of the Hyades of m - M = 3.376 {$\pm$} 0.01, a value close to the previous Hipparcos values, m - M = 3.33 {$\pm$} 0.02.

We determine membership probabilities by following a Bayesian approach using spatial and kinematic information of the potential cluster-Cepheid pairs. We confirm 19 Cepheid-cluster associations considered in previous studies as bona-fide, and question the established cluster membership of six other associations. In addition, we identify 138 cluster Cepheid candidates of potential interest, mostly in recently discovered open clusters. We report on at least two new clusters possibly hosting more than one Cepheid. Furthermore, we explore the feasibility of using open clusters hosting Cepheids to empirically determine the Cepheid period-age relation through the use of Gaia and 2MASS photometry and a semi-automated method to derive cluster ages. We conclude that the usage of cluster Cepheids as tentative probes of the period-age relations still faces difficulties due to the sparsely populated red giant branch and the stochastically sampled main-sequence turn-off of the open clusters, making age determinations a challenging task. This biases the age-dateable cluster selection for Cepheid period-age studies towards older and high-mass clusters.},

Rotation periods for stars in open clusters are essential to determine the relations between stellar age, rotation, and mass (color). Until recently, ambiguities in vsini data and lack of cluster membership information, prevented a clear empirical definition of the dependence of rotation on color. Direct measurements of stellar rotation periods for members in young clusters have now revealed a well-defined period-color relation. We show new results for the open clusters M35 and M34. However, rotation periods based on ground-based observations are limited to young clusters. The Hyades represent the oldest coeval population of stars with measured rotation periods. Measurements of rotation periods for older stars are needed to properly constrain the dependence of stellar rotation on age. We present our plans to use the Kepler space telescope to measure rotation periods in clusters as old as and older than the Sun.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery of a large, dynamically cold, coeval stellar stream that is currently traversing the immediate solar neighborhood at a distance of only 100 pc. The structure was identified in a wavelet decomposition of the 3D velocity space of all stars within 300 pc of the Sun. Its members form a highly elongated structure with a length of at least 400 pc, while its vertical extent measures only about 50 pc. Stars in the stream are not isotropically distributed but instead form two parallel lanes with individual local overdensities, that may correspond to a remnant core of a tidally disrupted cluster or OB association. Its members follow a very well-defined main sequence in the observational Hertzsprung-Russel diagram and also show a remarkably low 3D velocity dispersion of only 1.3 km s\textsuperscript{-1}. These findings strongly suggest a common origin as a single coeval stellar population. An extrapolation of the present-day mass function indicates a total mass of at least 2000 M\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}, making it larger than most currently known clusters or associations in the solar neighborhood. We estimated the age of the stream to be around 1 Gyr based on a comparison with a set of isochrones and giant stars in our member selection and find a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.04. This structure may very well represent the Galactic disk counterpart to the prominent stellar streams observed in the Milky Way halo. As such, it constitutes a new valuable probe to constrain the Galaxy's mass distribution.

We introduce a pioneering member identification method that is informed by cluster bulk velocities and deconvolves the spatial distribution with a mixture of Gaussians. Our approach enables inferring the clusters' true spatial distribution by effectively filtering field star contaminants while at the same time mitigating the impact of positional errors along the line of sight. This first application of the method reveals the existence of vast stellar coronae, extending for \$\textbackslash gtrsim\textbackslash,\$100 pc and surrounding the, by comparison tiny and compact, cluster cores. The coronae and cores form intertwined, co-eval, and co-moving extended cluster populations, each encompassing tens of thousands of cubic parsec and stretching across tens of degrees on the sky. Our analysis shows that the coronae are gravitationally unbound but largely comprise the bulk of the populations' stellar mass. Most systems are in a highly dynamic state, showing evidence of expansion and sometimes simultaneous contraction along different spatial axes. The velocity field of the extended populations for the cluster cores appears asymmetric but is aligned along a spatial axis unique to each cluster. The overall spatial distribution and the kinematic signature of the populations are largely consistent with the differential rotation pattern of the Milky Way. This finding underlines the important role of global Galactic dynamics to the fate of stellar systems. Our results highlight the complexity of the Milky Way's open cluster population and call for a new perspective on the characterization and dynamical state of open clusters.},

Clusters in our simulations experience the strongest tidal force in the first few hundred Myr after formation, when the maximum eigenvalue of the tidal tensor reaches several times 104 Gyr-2. After about 1 Gyr the tidal field plateaus at a lower value, with the median {$\mathsl{\lambda}$}m {$\sim$} 3 \texttimes{} 103 Gyr-2. The fraction of time clusters spend in high tidal strength ({$\mathsl{\lambda}$}m {$>$} 3 \texttimes{} 104 Gyr-2) regions also decreases with their age from {$\sim$}20\% immediately after formation to less than 1\% after 1 Gyr. At early ages both the in situ and ex situ clusters experience similar tidal fields, while at older ages the in situ clusters in general experience stronger tidal field due to their lower orbits in host galaxy. This difference is reflected in the survival of clusters: we looked into cluster disruption calculated in simulation runtime and found that ex situ star clusters of the same initial mass typically end up with higher bound fraction at the last available simulation snapshot than the in situ ones.},

The sample spans a range of different morphological types, allowing us to infer how the physical properties of the galaxy affect the spatial distribution of the clusters. We also prepare a range of physically motivated toy models to compare with and interpret the observed features in the TPCFs. We find that, conforming to earlier studies, young clusters (\$T \textbackslash la 10\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{Myr\}\$) have power-law TPCFs that are characteristic of fractal distributions with a fractal dimension \$D\_2\$, and this scale-free nature extends out to a maximum scale \$l\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{corr\}\}\$ beyond which the distribution becomes Poissonian. However, \$l\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{corr\}\}\$, and \$D\_2\$ vary significantly across the sample, and are correlated with a number of host galaxy physical properties, suggesting that there are physical differences in the underlying star cluster distributions. We also find that hierarchical structuring weakens with age, evidenced by flatter TPCFs for older clusters (\$T \textbackslash ga 10\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{Myr\}\$), that eventually converges to the residual correlation expected from a completely random large-scale radial distribution of clusters in the galaxy in \$\textbackslash sim 100 \textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{Myr\}\$. Our study demonstrates that the hierarchical distribution of star clusters evolves with age, and is strongly dependent on the properties of the host galaxy environment.},

The most reliable results are generally obtained when different methods are used in complementary way. We propose a new method for the age determination of young stellar associations and open clusters (ages {$<$} 125 Myr), which can allow to further constrain the age when used together with other methods. We explore the amplitude of the photometric variability in bins of color and rotation period of five young associations and clusters spanning an interval of ages from 1-3 Myr to 625 Myr (Taurus, rho Ophiuchi, Upper Scorpius, Pleiades, and Praesepe), which all have high-quality time-series photometry from Kepler K2 campaigns. In the low-mass regime, we find that stars with similar color and rotation period but different ages exhibit different amplitudes of their photometric variability, with younger stars showing a larger photometric variability than older stars. The decline of photometric variability amplitude versus age in stars with similar color and rotation period can be in principle calibrated and be adopted as an additional empirical relation to constrain the age of young associations and open clusters, provided that time-series photometry is available for their low-mass members.},

Most Galactic and extragalactic clusters exhibit internal variations of He, C, N, O, Na, and Al. They host two distinct stellar populations: the first population of stars, which resemble field stars with similar metallicities, and one or more second stellar populations that show the signature of high-temperature H-burning. In addition, a sub-sample of clusters hosts stellar populations with different heavy-element abundances. The MP origin remains one of the most puzzling, open issues of stellar astrophysics. We summarize the scenarios for the MP formation and depict the modern picture of GCs and their stellar populations along with the main evolutionary phases. We show that the MP behavior dramatically changes from one cluster to another and investigate their complexity to define common properties. We investigate relations with the host galaxy, the parameters of the host clusters (e.g., GC's mass, age, orbit), and stellar mass. We summarize results on spatial distribution and internal kinematics of MPs. Finally, we review the relation between MPs and the so-called second-parameter problem of the horizontal-branch morphology of GCs and summarize the main findings on the extended main-sequence phenomenon in young clusters.},

We use the proper motions (PMs) from the updated VVV Infrared Astrometric Catalog (VIRAC2) to select GC members and make deep near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to study the cluster properties. We also fit King models to the decontaminated sample to determine the GC structural parameters. Results. VVV-CL160 has an unusually large PM for a Galactic GC as measured with VIRAC2 and Gaia EDR3: \$\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash alpha\}\textbackslash cos(\textbackslash delta)\$ = \$-2.3 \textbackslash pm 0.1 \$ mas yr\$\^\{-1\}\$ and \$\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash delta\}\$ = \$-16.8 \textbackslash pm 0.1 \$ mas yr\$\^\{-1\}\$. The kinematics are similar to those of the known GC NGC 6544 and the Hrid halo stream. We estimate a reddening of \$E(J-K) = 1.95\$ mag and an extinction of \$A\_\{k\}= 1.40\$ mag for VVV-CL160. We also measure a distance modulus of \$(m-M) = 13.01\$ mag and a distance of \$D\_\{\textbackslash odot\} = 4.0 \textbackslash pm 0.5\$ kpc. This places the GC at \$z=29\$ pc above the Galactic plane and at a galactocentric distance of \$R\_G=4.2\$ kpc. We also measure a metallicity of \$[Fe/H] = -1.4 \textbackslash pm 0.2\$ dex for an adopted age of \$t=12\$ Gyr; King model fits of the PM-decontaminated sample reveal a concentrated GC, with core radius \$r\_\{c\}= 22.8"\$ and tidal radius \$r\_\{t\}= 50'\$. .... We also explore the possible association of this new GC with other GCs and halo streams. Conclusions. Based on the locations and kinematics, we suggest that VVV-CL160, along with NGC 6544, may be associated with the extension of the Hrid halo stream.},

  abstract = {We used a proper combination of high-resolution HST observations and wide-field ground based data to derive the radial star density profile of 26 Galactic globular clusters from resolved star counts (which can be all freely downloaded on-line). With respect to surface brightness (SB) profiles (which can be biased by the presence of sparse, bright stars), star counts are considered to be the most robust and reliable tool to derive cluster structural parameters. For each system a detailed comparison with both King and Wilson models has been performed and the most relevant best-fit parameters have been obtained. This is the largest homogeneous catalog collected so far of star count profiles and structural parameters derived therefrom. The analysis of the data of our catalog has shown that: (1) the presence of the central cusps previously detected in the SB profiles of NGC 1851, M13 and M62 is not confirmed; (2) the majority of clusters in our sample are fitted equally well by the King and the Wilson models; (3) we confirm the known relationship between cluster size (as measured by the effective radius) and galactocentric distances; (4) the ratio between the core and the effective radii shows a bimodal distribution, with a peak at {$\sim$} 0.3 for about 80\% of the clusters, and a secondary peak at {$\sim$} 0.6 for the remaining 20\%. Interestingly, the main peak turns out to be in agreement with what expected from simulations of cluster dynamical evolution and the ratio between these two radii well correlates with an empirical dynamical age indicator recently defined from the observed shape of blue straggler star radial distribution, thus suggesting that no exotic mechanisms of energy generation are needed in the cores of the analyzed clusters.},

On the other hand, the scatter of Mo abundances in the open cluster stars is slightly greater, 0.14 dex versus 0.11 dex.

After combining the samples from the various surveys and correcting for their respective selection effects, we find the properties of companions to O-type and B-type main-sequence (MS) stars differ among three regimes. First, at short orbital periods P {$<$} 20 days (separations a {$<$} 0.4 AU), the binaries have small eccentricities e {$<$} 0.4, favor modest mass ratios {$<$}q{$>$} = 0.5, and exhibit a small excess of twins q {$>$} 0.95. Second, the companion frequency peaks at intermediate periods log P (days) = 3.5 (a = 10 AU), where the binaries have mass ratios weighted toward small values q = 0.2-0.3 and follow a Maxwellian "thermal" eccentricity distribution. Finally, companions with long orbital periods log P (days) = 5.5-7.5 (a = 200-5,000 AU) are outer tertiary components in hierarchical triples, and have a mass ratio distribution across q = 0.1-1.0 that is nearly consistent with random pairings drawn from the initial mass function. We discuss these companion distributions and properties in the context of binary star formation and evolution. We also reanalyze the binary statistics of solar-type MS primaries, taking into account that (30+/-10)\% of single-lined spectroscopic binaries likely contain white dwarf companions instead of low-mass stellar secondaries. The mean frequency of stellar companions with q {$>$} 0.1 and log P (days) {$<$} 8.0 per primary increases from 0.50+/-0.04 for solar-type MS primaries to 2.1+/-0.3 for O-type MS primaries. We fit joint probability density functions f(M\_1,q,P,e) to the corrected distributions, which can be incorporated into binary population synthesis studies.},

  abstract = {In this work we explore the new catalog of galactic open clusters that became available recently, containing 1750 clusters that have been re-analysed using the Gaia DR2 catalog to determine the stellar memberships. We used the young open clusters as tracers of spiral arms and determined the spiral pattern rotation speed of the Galaxy and the corotation radius, the strongest Galactic resonance. The sample of open clusters used here increases the last one from Dias et al. (2019) used in the previous determination of the pattern speed by dozens objects. In addition, the distances and ages values are better determined, using improvements to isochrone fitting and including an updated extinction polynomial for the Gaia DR2 photometric band-passes, and the Galactic abundance gradient as a prior for metallicity. In addition to the better age determinations, the catalog contains better positions in the Galactic plane and better proper motions. This allow us to discuss not only the present space distribution of the clusters, but also the space distribution of the clusters's birthplaces, obtained by integration of the orbits for a time equal to their age. The value of the rotation velocity of the arms (\$28.5 \textbackslash pm 1.0\$ km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ kpc\$\^\{-1\}\$) implies that the corotation radius (\$R\_c\$) is close to the solar Galactic orbit (\$R\_c/R\_0 = 1.01\textbackslash pm0.08\$), which is supported by other observational evidence discussed in this text. A simulation is presented, illustrating the motion of the clusters in the reference frame of corotation. We also present general statistics of the catalog of clusters, like spatial distribution, distribution relative to height from the Galactic plane, and distribution of ages and metallicity. An important feature of the space distribution, the corotation gap in the gas distribution and its consequences for the young clusters, is discussed.},

The weights are obtained through a non parametric technique that takes into account the star distance to the observed center of the cluster, observed magnitude uncertainties, the stellar density profile of the cluster among others. The parameters determined simultaneously are distance, reddening, age and metallicity. The method takes binary fraction into account and uses a Monte-Carlo approach to obtain uncertainties on the determined parameters for the cluster by running the fitting algorithm many times with a re-sampled data set through a bootstrapping procedure. We present results for 9 well studied open clusters, based on 15 distinct data sets, and show that the results are consistent with previous studies. The method is shown to be reliable and free of the subjectivity of most previous visual isochrone fitting techniques.},

In this work, we use Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) to investigate 45 OCs listed in the New catalogue of optically visible open clusters and candidates (DAML) but with no previous astrometric membership estimation based on Gaia DR2. In the process of selecting targets for this study, we found that some clusters reported as new discoveries in recent papers based on Gaia DR2 were already known clusters listed in DAML. Cluster memberships were determined using a maximum likelihood method applied to Gaia DR2 astrometry. This has allowed us to estimate mean proper motions and mean parallaxes for all investigated clusters. Mean radial velocities were also determined for 12 clusters, 7 of which had no previous published values. We have improved our isochrone fitting code to account for interstellar extinction using an updated extinction polynomial for the Gaia DR2 photometric bandpasses and the Galactic abundance gradient as a prior for metallicity. The updated procedure was validated with a sample of clusters with high-quality [Fe/H] determinations. We then did a critical review of the literature and verified that our cluster parameter determinations represent a substantial improvement over previous values.},

A number of different relative validity criteria have been proposed for the validation of globular, clusters. Not all data, however, are composed of globular clusters. Density-based clustering algorithms seek partitions with high density areas of points (clusters, not necessarily globular) separated by low density areas, possibly containing noise objects. In these cases relative validity indices proposed for globular cluster validation may fail. In this paper we propose a relative validation index for density-based, arbitrarily shaped clusters. The index assesses clustering quality based on the relative density connection between pairs of objects. Our index is formulated on the basis of a new kernel density function, which is used to compute the density of objects and to evaluate the within- and between-cluster density connectedness of clustering results. Experiments on synthetic and real world data show the effectiveness of our approach for the evaluation and selection of clustering algorithms and their respective appropriate parameters.},

We carry out a non-parametric analysis of proper motions and membership determination. We investigate the reddening and proper motions of several dozen OB stars and red supergiants {$<$} 1 deg away from Wd 1. We identify a population of kinematic members of Wd 1 that largely includes the known spectroscopic members. From their EDR3 parallaxes, we derive a distance to the cluster of \$4.23\^\{+0.23\}\_\{-0.21\}\$kpc. Extinction in this direction increases by a large amount around 2.8 kpc, due to dark clouds associated to the Scutum-Crux arm. As a consequence, we hardly see any stars at distances comparable to that of the cluster. The proper motions of Wd 1, however, are very similar to those of stars in the field surrounding it, but distinct. We find a second, astrometrically well-defined population in the foreground (\$d\textbackslash approx2\textbackslash :\$kpc), likely connected to the possible open cluster BH197. Wd 1 is very elongated, an effect not driven by the very heavy extinction to the East and South. We find a low-density halo extending up to 10' from the cluster centre, mainly in the NW quadrant. A few OB stars at larger distances from the cluster, most notably the LBV MN48, share its proper motions, suggesting that Wd 1 has little or no peculiar motion with respect to the field population of the Norma arm. However, we are unable to find any red supergiant that could belong to an extended population related to the cluster, although we observe several dozen such objects in the foreground. We find a substantial population of luminous OB members obscured by several more magnitudes of extinction than most known members. These objects, mostly located in the central region of the cluster, increase the population of OB supergiants by about 25\%.},

  abstract = {We present a new comprehensive collection of stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones for rotating low- and intermediate-mass stars assembled with the updated version of PARSEC V2.0. This version includes our recent calibration of the extra mixing from overshooting and rotation, as well as several improvements in nuclear reaction network, treatment of convective zones, mass loss and other physical input parameters. The initial mass of the stellar models covers the range from 0.09 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ to 14 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$, for six sets of initial metallicity, from Z=0.004 to Z=0.017. Rotation is considered for stars above \$\textbackslash sim 1 M\_\textbackslash odot\$ with a smooth transition between non rotating and extremely fast-rotating models, based on the initial mass. For stars more massive than \$\textbackslash sim 1.3\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\$ the full rotation range, from low to the critical one, is considered. We adopt the solar-scaled chemical mixture by Caffau et al. with Z\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ = 0.01524. All the evolutionary phases from the pre-main-sequence to the first few thermal-pulses on the asymptotic-giant-branch or central C exhaustion, are considered. The corresponding theoretical isochrones are further derived with TRILEGAL code and are converted in several photometric systems, taking into account different inclination angles. Besides magnitudes, they also offer many other stellar observables in line with the data that are being provided by current large surveys. The new collection is fully integrated in a user friendly WEB interface for the benefit of easily performing stellar population studies.},

  abstract = {Globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way (MW) bulge are very difficult to study because: i) they suffer from the severe crowding and galactic extinction; which are characteristic of these inner Galactic regions ii) they are more prone to be affected by dynamical processes. Therefore, they are relatively faint and difficult to map. However, deep near-infrared photometry like that provided by the VISTA Variables in the Via L\textbackslash 'actea Extended Survey (VVVX) is allowing us to map GCs in this crucial yet relatively uncharted region. Our results confirm with high confidence that both FSR 19 and FSR 25 are genuine MW bulge GCs. Each of the performed tests and resulting parameters provides clear evidence for the GC nature of these targets. We derive distances of 7.2\$\textbackslash pm\$0.7 kpc and D=7.0\$\textbackslash pm\$0.6 (corresponding to distance moduli of 14.29\$\textbackslash pm\$0.08 and 14.23\$\textbackslash pm\$0.07) for FSR 19 and FSR 25, respectively. Their ages and metallicities are 11 Gyr and [Fe/H]= -0.5 dex for both clusters, which were determined from Dartmouth and PARSEC isochrone fitting. The integrated luminosities are M\$\_\{Ks\}\$(FSR 19) = -7.72 mag and M\$\_\{Ks\}\$(FSR 25) = -7.31 mag which places them in the faint tail of the GC Luminosity Function. By adopting a King profile for their number distribution, we determine their core and tidal radii (\$r\_c\$, \$r\_t\$). For FSR 19, r\$\_\{c\}\$= 2.76\$\textbackslash pm\$0.36 pc and r\$\_\{t\}\$=5.31\$\textbackslash pm\$0.49 pc, while FSR 25 appears more extended with r\$\_\{c\}\$= 1.92\$\textbackslash pm\$0.59 pc and r\$\_\{t\}\$=6.85\$\textbackslash pm\$1.78 pc. Finally their mean GC PMs (from Gaia EDR3) are \$\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash alpha\^\textbackslash ast\}\$= -2.50 \$\textbackslash pm\$0.76 mas \$yr\^\{-1\}\$, \$\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash delta\}\$= -5.02 \$\textbackslash pm\$0.47 mas \$yr\^\{-1\}\$ and \$\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash alpha\^\textbackslash ast\}\$= -2.61 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 1.27 mas \$yr\^\{-1\}\$ , \$\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash delta\}\$= -5.23 \$\textbackslash pm\$0.74 mas \$yr\^\{-1\}\$ for FSR 19 and FSR 25, respectively. \vphantom\{\}},

  abstract = {Context: Stellar clusters are benchmarks for theories of star formation and evolution. The high precision parallax data of the Gaia mission allows significant improvements in the distance determination to stellar clusters and its stars. In order to have accurate and precise distance determinations, systematics like the parallax spatial correlations need to be accounted for, especially for stars in small sky regions. Aims: Provide the astrophysical community with a free and open code designed to simultaneously infer cluster parameters (i.e. distance and size) and the distances to its stars using Gaia parallax measurements. It includes cluster oriented prior families and is specifically designed to deal with the Gaia parallax spatial correlations. Methods: A Bayesian hierarchical model is created to allow the inference of both the cluster parameters and distances to its stars. Results: Using synthetic data that mimics Gaia parallax uncertainties and spatial correlations, we observe that our cluster oriented prior families result in distance estimates with smaller errors than those obtained with an exponentially decreasing space density prior. In addition, the treatment of the parallax spatial correlations minimizes errors in the estimated cluster size and stellar distances and avoids the underestimation of uncertainties. Although neglecting the parallax spatial correlations has no impact on the accuracy of cluster distance determinations, it underestimates the uncertainties and may result in measurements that are incompatible with the true value. Conclusions: The combination of prior knowledge with the treatment of Gaia parallax spatial correlations produces accurate (error {$<$}10\%) and trustworthy estimates (i.e. true values contained within the 2\$\textbackslash sigma\$ uncertainties) of clusters distances for clusters up to \textasciitilde 5 kpc, and cluster sizes for clusters up to \textasciitilde 1 kpc.},

The value of \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{cluster{$<$}sub/{$>$} in the case of NGC 654, NGC 869 and NGC 884 is found to be normal, whereas the value of \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{cluster{$<$}sub/{$>$} in the cluster regions NGC 1502 and IC 1805 indicates an anomalous reddening law in these regions.

Members of OCs are identified using the unsupervised machine-learning method StarGO, using five parameters (X, Y, Z, \$\{\textbackslash mu \}\_\{\textbackslash alpha \}\textbackslash cos \textbackslash delta ,\{\textbackslash mu \}\_\{\textbackslash delta \}\$ ). The OC sample covers an age range of 25 Myr to 2.65 Gyr. We correct the asymmetric distance distribution that is due to parallax error using Bayesian inversion. The uncertainty in the corrected distance for a cluster at 500 pc is 3.0-6.3 pc, depending on the intrinsic spatial distribution of its members. We determine the 3D morphology of the OCs in our sample and fit the spatial distribution of stars within the tidal radius in each cluster with an ellipsoid model. The shapes of the OCs are well described with oblate spheroids (NGC 2547, NGC 2516, NGC 2451A, NGC 2451B, and NGC 2232), prolate spheroids (IC 2602, IC 4665, NGC 2422, Blanco 1, and Coma Berenices), or triaxial ellipsoids (IC 2391, NGC 6633, and NGC 6774). The semimajor axis of the fitted ellipsoid is parallel to the Galactic plane for most clusters. Elongated filament-like substructures are detected in three young clusters (NGC 2232, NGC 2547, and NGC 2451B), while tidal-tail-like substructures (tidal tails) are found in older clusters (NGC 2516, NGC 6633, NGC 6774, Blanco 1, and Coma Berenices). Most clusters may be supervirial and expanding. N-body models of rapid gas expulsion with a star formation efficiency of {$\asymp$}1/3 are consistent with clusters more massive than 250 M{$\odot$}, while clusters less massive than 250 M{$\odot$} tend to agree with adiabatic gas expulsion models. Only five OCs (NGC 2422, NGC 6633, NGC 6774, Blanco 1, and Coma Berenices) show clear signs of mass segregation.},

After adding members of twenty clusters from previous studies (Pang et al. 2021a,b; Li et al. 2021) we obtain 85 clusters, and study their morphology and kinematics. We classify the substructures outside the tidal radius into four categories: filamentary (f1) and fractal (f2) for clusters \${$<$}100\$ Myr, and halo (h) and tidal-tail (t) for clusters \${$>$}100\$ Myr. The kinematical substructures of f1-type clusters are elongated; these resemble the disrupted cluster Group X. Kinematic tails are distinct in t-type clusters, especially Pleiades. We identify 29 hierarchical groups in four young regions (Alessi 20, IC 348, LP 2373, LP 2442); ten among these are new. The hierarchical groups form filament networks. Two regions (Alessi 20, LP 2373) exhibit global "orthogonal" expansion (stellar motion perpendicular to the filament), which might cause complete dispersal. Infalling-like flows (stellar motion along the filament) are found in UBC 31 and related hierarchical groups in the IC 348 region. Stellar groups in the LP 2442 region (LP 2442 gp 1-5) are spatially well-mixed but kinematically coherent. A merging process might be ongoing in the LP 2442 subgroups. For younger systems (\$\textbackslash lesssim30\$ Myr), the mean axis ratio, cluster mass and half-mass radius tend to increase with age values. These correlations between structural parameters may imply two dynamical processes occurring in the hierarchical formation scenario in young stellar groups: (1) filament dissolution and (2) sub-group mergers.},

Five second-level substructures are disentangled in Vela OB2, which are referred to as Huluwa 1 (Gamma Velorum), Huluwa 2, Huluwa 3, Huluwa 4 and Huluwa 5. Huluwa 1-5 may have originated through sequential star formation. The clusters Huluwa 1-3 are the older generation, with ages of 10-20 Myr, and generated stellar feedback that caused turbulence which fostered the formation of the younger-generation clusters, Huluwa 4-5 (10 Myr). The cluster pair Collinder 135 and UBC 7 was likely formed from the same molecular cloud, are coeval (40 Myr). The 3D morphology of Huluwa 1-5 resembles a shell-like structure, right along the rim of the Vela IRAS shell. A supernova explosion located inside the Vela IRAS shell quenched star formation in the younger generation Huluwa 4-5 and rapidly expelled the remaining gas from the clusters. This resulted in mass stratification across the shell, with more low-mass stars located along the inner rim of the shell, and more massive stars in the outer region of the shell. Mass segregation is observed only in the lowest-mass cluster Huluwa 5.

Through a large suite of massless test particle simulations, we find that (1) subhalos with masses less than \$10\^8 M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ negligibly affect test particle orbits, (2) perturbations lead to orbital deviations only in environments with substructure fractions \$f\_\{sub\} \textbackslash geq 1\textbackslash\%\$, (3) perturbations from denser subhalos produce larger orbital deviations, and (4) subhalo perturbations that are strong relative to the background tidal field lead to larger orbital deviations. To predict how the variation in test particle orbital energy \$\textbackslash sigma\_e(t)\$ increases with time, we test the applicability of theory derived from single-mass subhalo populations to populations where subhalos have a mass spectrum. We find \$\textbackslash sigma\_e(t)\$ can be predicted for test particle evolution within a mass spectrum of subhalos by assuming subhalos all have masses equal to the mean subhalo mass and by using the local mean subhalo separation to estimate the change in test particle velocities due to subhalo interactions. Furthermore, the orbital distance variation at an orbital distance \$r\$ can be calculated via \$\textbackslash sigma\_r=2.98 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-5\} \textbackslash pm 8 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-8\} (\textbackslash rm kpc\^\{-1\} km\^\{-2\} s\^\{2\}) \textbackslash times r \textbackslash times \textbackslash sigma\_e\$ with a dispersion about the line of best fit equalling 0.08 kpc.

Apart from the two well known clusters, IC 348 and NGC 1333, we present five new clustered groups of young stars, which contain between 30 and 300 members, named Autochthe, Alcaeus, Heleus, Electryon and Mestor. We demonstrate these are co-moving groups of young stars, based on how the candidate members are distributed in position, proper motion, parallax and colour-magnitude space. By comparing their colour-magnitude diagrams to isochrones we show that they have ages between 1 and 5 Myr. Using 2MASS and WISE colours we find that the fraction of stars with discs in each group ranges from 10 to 50 percent. The youngest of the new groups is also associated with a reservoir of cold dust, according to the Planck map at 353 GHz. We compare the ages and proper motions of the five new groups to those of IC 348 and NGC 1333. Autochthe is clearly linked with NGC 1333 and may have formed in the same star formation event. The seven groups separate roughly into two sets which share proper motion, parallax and age: Heleus, Electryon, Mestor as the older set, and NGC 1333, Autochthe as the younger set. Alcaeus is kinematically related to the younger set, but at a more advanced age, while the properties of IC 348 overlap with both sets. All older groups in this star forming region are located at higher galactic latitude.},

  abstract = {Observational results of young star-forming regions suggest that star clusters are completely mass segregated at birth. As a star cluster evolves dynamically, these initial conditions are gradually lost. For star clusters with single stars only and a canonical IMF, it has been suggested that traces of these initial conditions vanish at a time \$\textbackslash tau\_\textbackslash mathrm\{v\}\$ between \$3\$ and \$3.5\textbackslash,t\_\textbackslash mathrm\{rh\}\$ (initial half-mass relaxation times). Since a significant fraction of stars are observed in binary systems and it is widely accepted that most stars are born in binary systems we investigate what role a primordial binary population (even up to \$100\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ binaries) plays in the loss of primordial mass segregation of young star clusters. We use numerical \$N\$-body models similar in size to the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) -- a representative of young open clusters -- integrated over several relaxation times to draw conclusions on the evolution of its mass segregation. We also compare our models to the observed ONC. We found that \$\textbackslash tau\_\textbackslash mathrm\{v\}\$ depends on the binary star fraction and the distribution of initial binary parameters that include semi-major axis, eccentricity and mass ratio. For instance, in the models with \$50\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ binaries, we find \$\textbackslash tau\_\textbackslash mathrm\{v\} = (2.7 \textbackslash pm 0.8)\textbackslash,t\_\textbackslash mathrm\{rh\}\$, while for \$100\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ binary fraction, we find a lower value, i.e. \$\textbackslash tau\_\textbackslash mathrm\{v\} = (2.1 \textbackslash pm 0.6)\textbackslash,t\_\textbackslash mathrm\{rh\}\$. We also conclude that the initially completely mass segregated clusters, even with binaries, are more compatible with the present-day ONC than the non-segregated ones.},

Until the release of the fourth Gaia data release, we lack the full astrometric time-series that the satellite records, but as we show can still infer the presence of binaries from the best-fitting models, and their error, already available. We generate a broad catalogue of simulated binary systems within 100 pc, and examine synthetic observations matching the Gaia survey's scanning law and astrometric data processing routine. We show how the unit weight error (UWE) and proper motion anomaly (PMA) vary as a function of period, and the properties of the binary. Both UWE and PMA peak for systems with a binary period close to the time baseline of the survey. Thus UWE can be expected to increase or remain roughly constant as we observe the same system over a longer baseline, and we suggest UWEeDR3 {$>$} 1.25 and {$\Delta$}UWE/UWEeDR3 {$>$} -0.25 as criteria to select astrometric binaries. For stellar binaries, we find detectable significant astrometric deviations for 80-90 per cent of our simulated systems in a period range from months to decades. We confirm that for systems with periods less than the survey's baseline the observed UWE scales {$\propto$} {$\varpi$} (parallax), a (semimajor axis), and \$\textbackslash Delta =\textbackslash frac\{|q-l|\}\{(1+q)(1+l)\}\$, where q and l are the mass and light ratio, respectively, with a modest dependence on viewing angle. For longer periods the signal is suppressed by a factor of roughly {$\propto$}P-2 (period). PMA is largest in orbits with slightly longer periods but obeys the same approximate scaling relationships.},

We identify 22 699 binary candidates within 100 pc of the Sun (just under 10 per cent of sources in this volume). We find an astrometric binary candidate fraction of around 20 per cent for giant stars, 10 per cent on the main sequence and lower than 1 per cent for white dwarfs. We also look for Variability Induced Movers, by computing the correlation between photometric variability and astrometric noise - and show that VIMs may dominate the binary population of sub-Solar mass MS stars. We discuss the possibility and limitations of identifying non-luminous massive companions from astrometry alone, but find that our method is insensitive to these. Finally, we compare the astrometric deviations of MS binaries to the simulated sample from paper I, which show excellent agreement, and compute the astrometric candidate binary fraction as a function of absolute magnitude.},

The discrepancy between the centre of mass of the system (which moves like a point mass) and the centre of light (which is what we observe) introduces additional motion. We explore the extent to which binary systems affect single object model fit to astrometric data. This tells us how observations are diluted by binaries and which systems cause the largest discrepancies - but it also allows us to make inferences about the binarity of populations based on observed astrometric error. By examining a sample of mock observations, we show that binaries with periods close to 1 yr can mimic parallax and thus bias distance measurements, while long-period binaries can introduce significant apparent proper motion. While these changes can soak up some of the error introduced by the binary, the total deviation from the best-fitting model can be translated into a lower limit on the on-sky separation of the pair. Throughout, we link these predictions to data from the Gaia satellite, while leaving the conclusions generalizable to other surveys.},

These parameters are later on employed in larger scale analyses, for example the structure of the Galaxy's spiral arms. The distance is one of the more straightforward parameters to estimate, yet enormous differences can still be found among published data. This is particularly true for open clusters located more than a few kpc away. We cross-matched several published catalogues and selected the twenty-five most distant open clusters (\${$>\$$}9000 pc). We then performed a detailed analysis of their fundamental parameters, with emphasis on their distances, to determine the agreement between catalogues and our estimates.\vphantom\{\} Photometric and astrometric data from the Gaia EDR3 survey was employed. The data was processed with our own membership analysis code (pyUPMASK), and our package for automatic fundamental cluster's parameters estimation (\$\textbackslash texttt\{ASteCA\}\$). We find differences in the estimated distances of up to several kpc between our results and those catalogued, even for the catalogues that show the best matches with \$\textbackslash texttt\{ASteCA\}\$ values. Large differences are also found for the age estimates. As a by-product of the analysis we find that vd Bergh-Hagen 176 could be the open cluster with the largest heliocentric distance catalogued to date. Caution is thus strongly recommended when using catalogued parameters of open clusters to infer large-scale properties of the Galaxy, particularly for those located more than a few kpc away.},

(2) To address previously reported systematics in Gaia DR2 parallaxes by comparing the cluster distances derived from photometry with those derived from parallaxes. Methods: Deep UBVI photometry of 16 open clusters was carried out. Observations were reduced and analyzed in an automaticway using the ASteCA package to get individual distances, reddening, masses, ages and metallicities. Photometric distances were compared to those obtained from a Bayesian analysis of Gaia DR2 parallaxes. Results: Ten out of the 16 clusters are true or highly probable open clusters. Two of them are quite young and follow the trace of the Carina Arm and the already detected warp. The rest of the clusters are placed in the interarm zone between the Perseus and Carina Arms as expected for older objects. We found that the cluster van den Berg-Hagen 85 is 7.5\$\textbackslash times\$10\$\^9\$ yrs old becoming then one of the oldest open cluster detected in our Galaxy so far. The relationship of these ten clusters with the Galaxy structure in the solar neighborhood is discussed. The comparison of distances from photometry and parallaxes data, in turn, reveals a variable level of disagreement. Conclusions: Various zero point corrections for Gaia DR2 parallax data recently reported were considered for a comparison between photometric and parallax based distances. The results tend to improve with some of these corrections. Photometric distance analysis suggest an average correction of \$\textbackslash sim\$+0.026 mas (to be added to the parallaxes). The correction may have a more intricate distance dependency, but addressing that level of detail will require a larger cluster sample.},

Recently, the analysis of Gaia data revealed large asymmetries between the leading and trailing tidal tail arms of the four open star clusters Hyades, Praesepe, Coma Berenices and NGC 752. Aims: As the evaporation of stars from star clusters into the tidal tails is a stochastic process, the degree of stochastic asymmetry is quantified in this work. Methods: For each star cluster 1000 configurations of test particles are integrated in the combined potential of a Plummer sphere and the Galactic tidal field over the life time of the particular star cluster. For each of the four star clusters the distribution function of the stochastic asymmetry is determined and compared with the observed asymmetry. Results: The probabilities for a stochastic origin of the observed asymmetry of the four star clusters are: Praesepe \textasciitilde 1.7 sigma, Coma Berenices \textasciitilde 2.4 sigma, Hyades \textasciitilde 6.7 sigma, NGC 752 \textasciitilde 1.6 sigma. Conclusions: In the case of Praesepe, Coma Berenices and NGC 752 the observed asymmetry can be interpreted as a stochastic evaporation event. However, for the formation of the asymmetric tidal tails of the Hyades additional dynamical processes beyond a pure statistical evaporation effect are required.},

Indeed, they resemble those of ages and metallicities of composite star field populations. We also traced their stellar number density profiles and mass functions, derived their total masses, Jacobi and tidal radii, which helped us as criteria while assessing their physical nature as real open clusters.

From star-by-star reddening corrected color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) we defined four adjacent strips along the MS, for which we built the respective stellar density maps, once the contamination by field stars was properly removed. The resulting field star cleaned stellar density maps show a short tidal tail and some scattered debris. Such extra-tidal features are hardly detected when much shallower Gaia DR2 data sets are used and the same CMD field star cleaning procedure is applied. Indeed, by using 2.5 magnitudes below the cluster MS turnoff as the faintest limit (G {$<$} 20.5 mag), cluster members turned out to be distributed within the cluster's tidal radius, and some hints for field star density variations are found across a circle of radius 3.5deg centered on the cluster and with similar CMD features as cluster stars. The proper motion distribution of these stars is distinguishable from that of the cluster, with some superposition, which resembles that of stars located beyond 3.5deg from the cluster center.},

When exploring different kinematical and structural parameter spaces, we found that globular clusters - irrespective from the presence of tidal tails, or any other kind of extra-tidal features or the absence of them - behave similarly. In general, globular clusters whose orbits are relatively more eccentric and very inclined respect to the Milky Way plane have undergone a larger amount of mass-loss by tidal disruption. The latter has also accelerated the internal dynamics toward a comparatively more advanced stage of evolution. These outcomes show that it is not straightforward to find any particular set of parameter space and dynamical conditions that can definitely predict tidal tails along globular clusters in the Milky Way.},

Using the most recent list of open clusters, we compare the cited central parallaxes with the histograms of parallax distributions of cluster aggregates. The aggregates were chosen based on the member stars which are shared by multiple clusters. Many of the clusters in the aggregates have been assigned parallaxes which coincide with the histograms. However, clusters that share a large number of members in a small volume of the phase space display parallax distributions which do not coincide with the values from the literature. This is the result of ignoring a possibility of assigning multiple probabilities to a single star. We propose that this small number of clusters should be analysed anew.},

For the analysis of the age distribution we used 2242 clusters, which all lie within roughly 2.5 kpc of the Sun. To connect the observed age distribution to the cluster formation history we built an analytical model based on simple assumptions on the cluster initial mass function and on the cluster mass-lifetime relation, fit it to the observations, and determined the parameters of the cluster formation law.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Comparison with the literature shows that earlier results strongly underestimated the number of evolved clusters with ages \emph{t{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 100 Myr. Recent studies based on all-sky catalogues agree better with our data, but still lack the oldest clusters with ages \emph{t{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1 Gyr. We do not observe a strong variation in the age distribution along \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{G{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$}, though we find an enhanced fraction of older clusters (\emph{t{$<$}i/{$>$} {$>$} 1 Gyr) in the inner disk. In contrast, the distribution strongly varies along \emph{Z{$<$}i/{$>$}. The high altitude distribution practically does not contain clusters with \emph{t{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 1 Gyr. With simple assumptions on the cluster formation history, the cluster initial mass function and the cluster lifetime we can reproduce the observations. The cluster formation rate and the cluster lifetime are strongly degenerate, which does not allow us to disentangle different formation scenarios. In all cases the cluster formation rate is strongly declining with time, and the cluster initial mass function is very shallow at the high mass end.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Context: In a previous paper we obtained King's parameters for 236 of 650 Galactic open clusters identified in the ASCC-2.5. Aims: Estimating tidal radii by use of observable parameters available for all clusters. Bias-free results are required. Methods: We use methods of stellar statistics and develop a semi-empirical model of open clusters. Results: We check two effects impacting the determination of tidal radii from a fitting of King's profiles to the observed density distribution, i.e., ellipticity of open clusters and a bias depending on distances. Though a typical cluster has an elliptical form, the effect is rather weak to produce a prominent bias in the resulting tidal radii. In contrast, a distance dependent bias is not negligible and can cause a systematic underestimation of tidal radii computed with ASCC-2.5 data by a factor of two for the most distant clusters of our sample. This finding is used to correct the original results for 236 clusters and to extend the system of tidal radii and masses to all 650 clusters. We found that the semi-major axis of the projected distribution of cluster members on the sky is a parameter suited to estimate tidal radii of open clusters of our sample. No systematic differences are found between measured and calibrated tidal radii. From the comparison with mass estimates based on star counts and on the assumption of the Salpeter IMF, empirical evidence is obtained for an evolution of cluster mass functions starting in young clusters. Conclusions: The set of homogeneous parameters available for all clusters of our sample is extended by tidal radius and mass. Within 850 pc where our sample is complete, the distributions of tidal radii and masses peak at rt {$\approx$} 6 pc and log M\_c/m\_{$\odot$} {$\approx$} 2.5, respectively. In young open clusters, the mass distributions show differences to the Salpeter IMF, and this discrepancy increases with cluster age. The determined tidal radii and masses for 650 clusters are listed in a table that is available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/477/165},

Two new OB associations have been identified in the Carina-Vela and Cepheus-Cygnus-Lyra-Vulpecula regions. A very probable new open cluster has been discovered in Carina. The cluster, a Car, named after its brightest member, is young (60 Myr) and nearby (d = 132 pc). However, only seven bona fide members can be drawn from the Hipparcos data. We report a detection of nine open cluster candidates in the distance range of 150 to 400 pc, and six possible associations almost all located within the Gould belt, although slightly older than the known nearby associations. In all cases, we present Yale theoretical isochrone fits to the color-magnitude diagrams, which indicate a moderate spread of ages between 60 to 200 Myr. Evidently, these young open cluster and association candidates are related to the overall distribution of young OB and A-type stars in the solar neighborhood.},

  abstract = {The chemical homogeneity of surviving stellar clusters contains important clues about interstellar medium (ISM) mixing efficiency, star formation, and the enrichment history of the Galaxy. Existing measurements in a handful of open clusters suggest homogeneity in several elements at the 0.03 dex level. Here we present (i) a new cluster member catalog based only on APOGEE radial velocities and Gaia-DR2 proper motions, (ii) improved abundance uncertainties for APOGEE cluster members, and (iii) the dependence of cluster homogeneity on Galactic and cluster properties, using abundances of eight elements from the APOGEE survey for ten high-quality clusters. We find that cluster homogeneity is uncorrelated with Galactocentric distance, |Z|, age, and metallicity. However, velocity dispersion, which is a proxy for cluster mass, is positively correlated with intrinsic scatter at relatively high levels of significance for [Ca/Fe] and [Mg/Fe]. We also see a possible positive correlation at a low level of significance for [Ni/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Fe/H], while [Cr/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] are uncorrelated. The elements that show a correlation with velocity dispersion are those that are predominantly produced by core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). However, the small sample size and relatively low correlation significance highlight the need for follow-up studies. If borne out by future studies, these findings would suggest a quantitative difference between the correlation lengths of elements produced predominantly by Type\textasciitilde Ia SNe versus CCSNe, which would have implications for Galactic chemical evolution models and the feasibility of chemical tagging.},

  abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars that form the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Several examples exist in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst and interacting galaxies. The few YMCs that are close enough to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the ecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations. YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review, we focus on star clusters younger than {$\sim$}100 Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and more massive than {$\sim$}10\textsuperscript{4}M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}; the size of the cluster and its environment are considered less relevant as distinguishing parameters. We describe the global properties of the currently known young massive star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of the art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. In order to make this review readable by observers, theorists, and computational astrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.},

  abstract = {Chemically tagging groups of stars born in the same birth cluster is a major goal of spectroscopic surveys. To investigate the feasibility of such strong chemical tagging, we perform a blind chemical tagging experiment on abundances measured from APOGEE survey spectra. We apply a density-based clustering algorithm to the eight dimensional chemical space defined by [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Si/Fe], [K/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Mn/Fe], [Fe/H], and [Ni/Fe], abundances ratios which together span multiple nucleosynthetic channels. In a high quality sample of 182,538 giant stars, we detect twenty-one candidate clusters with more than fifteen members. Our candidate clusters are more chemically homogeneous than a population of non-member stars with similar [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H], even in abundances not used for tagging. Group members are consistent with having the same age and fall along a single stellar-population track in logg vs. Teff space. Each group's members are distributed over multiple kpc, and the spread in their radial and azimuthal actions increases with age. We qualitatively reproduce this increase using N-body simulations of cluster dissolution in Galactic potentials that include transient winding spiral arms. Observing our candidate birth clusters with high-resolution spectroscopy in other wavebands to investigate their chemical homogeneity in other nucleosynthetic groups will be essential to confirming the efficacy of strong chemical tagging. Our initially spatially-compact but now widely dispersed candidate clusters will provide novel limits on chemical evolution and orbital diffusion in the Galactic disc, and constraints on star formation in loosely-bound groups.},

At its present Galactocentric position (R, z) {$\sim$} (23, 15) kpc, the association is (on the sky) near the leading arm of the gas stream emanating from the Magellanic cloud system, but is located {$\approx$} 60{$\smwhtcircle$} from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) center on the other side of the Milky Way (MW) disk. If the cluster is co-located with HI gas in the stream, we directly measure the distance to the leading arm of the Magellanic stream. The measured distance is inconsistent with Magellanic stream model predictions that do not account for ram pressure and gas interaction with the MW disk. The estimated age of the cluster is consistent with the time of last passage of the leading arm gas through the Galactic midplane; We therefore speculate that this star-formation event was triggered by its last disk midplane passage. Most details of this idea remain a puzzle: the Magellanic stream has low column density, the MW disk at large radii has low gas density, and the relative velocity of the leading arm and MW gas is large. However it formed, the discovery of a young stellar cluster in the MW halo presents an interesting opportunity for study. This cluster was discovered with Gaia astrometry and photometry alone, but follow-up DECam photometry was crucial for measuring its properties.},

Cluster membership can be utilized to establish the precise distances, luminosities, ages, and progenitor masses of such WDs. We compile a list of probable WDs that are OC members in order to facilitate WD studies that are impractical or difficult to conduct for Galactic field WDs. We use recent catalogs of WDs and OCs that are based on the second data release of the \textbackslash textit\{Gaia\} satellite mission (GDR2) to identify WDs that are OC members. This crossmatch is facilitated by the astrometric and photometric data contained in GDR2 and the derived catalogs. Assuming that most of the WD members are of the DA type, we estimate the WD masses, cooling ages, and progenitor masses. We have detected several new likely WD members and reassessed the membership of the literature WDs that had been previously associated with the studied OCs. Several of the recovered WDs fall into the recently reported discontinuity in the initial-final mass relation (IFMR) around \$M\_\{i\} \textbackslash sim 2.0 M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, which allows for tighter constrains on the IFMR in this regime.},

All candidates were selected according to their position in the color-magnitude diagram, to their proper motion components, and to their parallax. We also looked for yellow stragglers, i.e., possible evolved blue stragglers. We found that Trumpler 5 hosts a large BSS population, which allowed us to analyze their radial distribution as a probe of the cluster's dynamical status. The BSS distribution was compared with that of red giant branch stars (RGB) to evaluate mass segregation. Our results indicate that blue straggler stars are not more centrally concentrated than RGB stars in any of the clusters. The radial distribution of BSS in Trumpler 5 is flat. Additionally, using a multi-epoch radial velocity survey conducted with the high-resolution spectrograph FLAMES/GIRAFFE at VLT, we measured the radial velocities of a sample of stragglers, for the sake of comparison with the mean radial velocity and the velocity dispersion of the clusters. Based on the radial velocity variations for different epochs, we roughly classified these stars as possible close-or long-period binaries.},

Extending the analysis towards fainter magnitudes in cluster sequences has a significant impact on the derived fundamental parameters, such as extinction and total mass. We perform a homogeneous analysis of six open stellar clusters in the Galactic disk using kinematic and photometric information from the Gaia DR2 and VVV surveys: NGC6067, NGC6259, NGC4815, Pismis18, Trumpler23, and Trumpler20.

For the studied clusters, with ages in the \$\textbackslash sim\$120-1900 Myr range, we report an increase of \$\textbackslash sim\$45 \% new member candidates on average in our sample. The data-driven selection approach of cluster members makes our catalog a valuable resource for testing stellar evolutionary models and for assessing the cluster low-to-intermediate mass populations.

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Determination and calibration of the ages of stars, which heavily rely on stellar evolutionary models, are very challenging, while representing a crucial aspect in many astrophysical areas.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We describe the methodologies that, taking advantage of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$}-DR1 and the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$}-ESO Survey data, enable the comparison of observed open star cluster sequences with stellar evolutionary models. The final, long-term goal is the exploitation of open clusters as age calibrators.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We perform a homogeneous analysis of eight open clusters using the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$}-DR1 TGAS catalogue for bright members and information from the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$}-ESO Survey for fainter stars. Cluster membership probabilities for the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$}-ESO Survey targets are derived based on several spectroscopic tracers. The \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$}-ESO Survey also provides the cluster chemical composition. We obtain cluster parallaxes using two methods. The first one relies on the astrometric selection of a sample of bona fide members, while the other one fits the parallax distribution of a larger sample of TGAS sources. Ages and reddening values are recovered through a Bayesian analysis using the 2MASS magnitudes and three sets of standard models. Lithium depletion boundary (LDB) ages are also determined using literature observations and the same models employed for the Bayesian analysis.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} For all but one cluster, parallaxes derived by us agree with those presented in Gaia Collaboration (2017, A\&A, 601, A19), while a discrepancy is found for NGC 2516; we provide evidence supporting our own determination. Inferred cluster ages are robust against models and are generally consistent with literature values.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} The systematic parallax errors inherent in the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR1 data presently limit the precision of our results. Nevertheless, we have been able to place these eight clusters onto the same age scale for the first time, with good agreement between isochronal and LDB ages where there is overlap. Our approach appears promising and demonstrates the potential of combining \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} and ground-based spectroscopic datasets.}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {In the last 15 years different ground-based spectroscopic surveys have been started (and completed) with the general aim of delivering stellar parameters and elemental abundances for large samples of Galactic stars, complementing Gaia astrometry. Among those surveys, the Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey (GES), the only one performed on a 8m class telescope, was designed to target 100,000 stars using FLAMES on the ESO VLT (both Giraffe and UVES spectrographs), covering all the Milky Way populations, with a special focus on open star clusters. This article provides an overview of the survey implementation (observations, data quality, analysis and its success, data products, and releases), of the open cluster survey, of the science results and potential, and of the survey legacy. A companion article (Gilmore et al.) reviews the overall survey motivation, strategy, Giraffe pipeline data reduction, organisation, and workflow. The GES has determined homogeneous good-quality radial velocities and stellar parameters for a large fraction of its more than 110,000 unique target stars. Elemental abundances were derived for up to 31 elements for targets observed with UVES. Lithium abundances are delivered for about 1/3 of the sample. The analysis and homogenisation strategies have proven to be successful; several science topics have been addressed by the Gaia-ESO consortium and the community, with many highlight results achieved. The final catalogue has been released through the ESO archive at the end of May 2022, including the complete set of advanced data products. In addition to these results, the Gaia-ESO Survey will leave a very important legacy, for several aspects and for many years to come.},

The difference between maximum and minimum values of E(B - V ) indicates the presence of non-uniform extinction in all the clusters except Collinder 69, NGC 2362 and NGC 2384. The colour excess ratios are consistent with a normal extinction law for the clusters NGC 6823, Haffner 18, Haffner 19, NGC 7160, NGC 6193, NGC 2401, NGC 2384, NGC 6871, NGC 7380, Berkeley 7, Collinder 69 and IC 4996. We have found that the differential color-excess {$\increment$}E(B - V ), which may be due to the occurrence of dust and gas inside the clusters, decreases with the age of the clusters. A spatial variation of color excess is found in NGC 6193 in the sense that it decreases from east to west in the cluster region. For the clusters Berkeley 7, NGC 7380 and NGC 6871, a dependence of color excess E(B - V ) with spectral class and luminosity is observed. Eight stars in Collinder 232, four stars in NGC 6530 and one star in NGC 6231 have excess flux in near-IR. This indicates that these stars may have circumstellar material around them.},

The area enclosed between the cumulative radial distributions of BSS and a reference population up to the half-mass radius of the clusters, \$A\^+\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{rh\}\}\$, is known to be a measure of the sedimentation of BSS in GCs. In this work, we calculate \$A\^+\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{rh\}\}\$ for 12 open clusters (OCs) using main-sequence turn-off stars as a reference population. The BSS as well as the main-sequence turn-off stars for these clusters are identified using the proper motions and parallaxes from the Gaia DR2 data, with spectroscopically confirmed BSS populations for some of these clusters available in the literature. Using the Pearson and Spearman rank correlation coefficients, we find weak correlations between the estimated values of \$A\^+\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{rh\}\}\$ and other markers of dynamical ages of the clusters, i.e., the number of central relaxations a cluster has experienced since its formation, and the structural parameters of the clusters. Based on statistical tests, we find that these correlations are similar to the corresponding correlations among the less evolved GCs, albeit within large errors.},

  abstract = {In this paper we explore the effects that the presence of a fraction of binary stars has in the determination of a star cluster mass via the virial theorem. To reach this aim in an accurate and consistent way, we run a set of simulations using the direct summation, high precision, code NBODY7. By means of this suite of simulations we are able to quantify the overestimate of open-star-cluster-like models' dynamical masses when making a straight application of the virial theorem using available position and radial velocity measurements. The mass inflation caused by the binary 'heating' contribution to the measured velocity dispersion depends, of course, on the initial binary fraction, \$f\_\{b0\}\$ and its following dynamical evolution. For an \$f\_\{b\}\$ (evolved up to 1.5 Gyr) in the range \$8\textbackslash\% - 42\textbackslash\%\$ the overestimate of the mass done using experimentally sounding estimates for the velocity dispersion can be up to a factor 45. We provide a useful fitting formula to correct the dynamical mass determination for the presence of binaries, and underline how neglecting the role of binaries in stellar systems might lead to erroneous conclusions about their total mass budget. If this trend remains valid for larger systems like dwarf spheroidal galaxies, which are still far out of reach for high precision dynamical simulations taking account their binaries, it would imply an incorrect over-estimation of their dark matter content, as inferred by means of available velocity dispersion measurements.},

  abstract = {In recent years many works have shown that unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) can help detect unusual objects and uncover trends in large astronomical datasets, but a few challenges remain. We show here, for example, that different methods, or even small variations of the same method, can produce significantly different outcomes. While intuitively somewhat surprising, this can naturally occur when applying unsupervised ML to highly dimensional data, where there can be many reasonable yet different answers to the same question. In such a case the outcome of any single unsupervised ML method should be considered a sample from a conceivably wide range of possibilities. We therefore suggest an approach that eschews finding an optimal outcome, instead facilitating the production and examination of many valid ones. This can be achieved by incorporating unsupervised ML into data visualisation portals. We present here such a portal that we are developing, applied to the sample of SDSS spectra of galaxies. The main feature of the portal is interactive 2D maps of the data. Different maps are constructed by applying dimensionality reduction to different subspaces of the data, so that each map contains different information that in turn gives a different perspective on the data. The interactive maps are intuitive to use, and we demonstrate how peculiar objects and trends can be detected by means of a few button clicks. We believe that including tools in this spirit in next generation astronomical surveys will be important for making unexpected discoveries, either by professional astronomers or by citizen scientists, and will generally enable the benefits of visual inspection even when dealing with very complex and extensive datasets. Our portal is available online at galaxyportal.space.},

  abstract = {Driven by recent observational findings, we select massive interactive binaries as the most suitable among the existing candidates for producing the chemical patterns typical of multiple populations of Galactic globular clusters. Still, to avoid supernova contamination we are further driven to endorse the notion that above a critical mass stars fail to produce supernova events, but rather eventually sink into black holes without ejecting much energy and heavy metals. This assumption has the attractive implication of suppressing star formation feedback for some 5--10 million years, in practice leading to runaway star formation, analog to \{\textbackslash it overcooling\} that in absence of feedback would have turned most baryons into stars in the early Universe. Under such conditions, multiple episodes of stars formation, incorporating binary star ejecta from previous episodes, appear to be unavoidable, thus accounting for the ubiquity of the multiple population phenomenon in globular clusters.},

A data volume of this size and granularity requires a robust and reliable but still flexible system to achieve the demanding accuracy and precision constraints that \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} is capable of delivering.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We aim to describe the input data, the treatment of blue photometer/red photometer (BP/RP) low-resolution spectra required to produce the integrated \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{BP{$<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RP{$<$}sub/{$>$} fluxes, the process used to establish the internal \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} photometric system, and finally, the generation of the mean source photometry from the calibrated epoch data for \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The internal \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} photometric system was initialised using an iterative process that is solely based on \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} data. A set of calibrations was derived for the entire \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 baseline and then used to produce the final mean source photometry. The photometric catalogue contains 2.5 billion sources comprised of three different grades depending on the availability of colour information and the procedure used to calibrate them: 1.5 billion gold, 144 million silver, and 0.9 billion bronze. These figures reflect the results of the photometric processing; the content of the data release will be different due to the validation and data quality filters applied during the catalogue preparation. The photometric processing pipeline, PhotPipe, implements all the processing and calibration workflows in terms of Map/Reduce jobs based on the Hadoop platform. This is the first example of a processing system for a large astrophysical survey project to make use of these technologies.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} The improvements in the generation of the integrated \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textendash band fluxes, in the attitude modelling, in the cross-matching, and and in the identification of spurious detections led to a much cleaner input stream for the photometric processing. This, combined with the improvements in the definition of the internal photometric system and calibration flow, produced high-quality photometry. Hadoop proved to be an excellent platform choice for the implementation of PhotPipe in terms of overall performance, scalability, downtime, and manpower required for operations and maintenance.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Gaia Early Data Release 3 contains astrometry and photometry results for about 1.8 billion sources based on observations collected by the ESA Gaia satellite during the first 34 months of operations. This paper focuses on the photometric content, describing the input data, the algorithms, the processing, and the validation of the results. Particular attention is given to the quality of the data and to a number of features that users may need to take into account to make the best use of the EDR3 catalogue. The treatment of the BP and RP background has been updated to include a better estimation of the local background, and the detection of crowding effects has been used to exclude affected data from the calibrations. The photometric calibration models have also been updated to account for flux loss over the whole magnitude range. Significant improvements in the modelling and calibration of the point and line spread functions have also helped to reduce a number of instrumental effects that were still present in DR2. EDR3 contains 1.806 billion sources with G-band photometry and 1.540 billion sources with BP and RP photometry. The median uncertainty in the G-band photometry, as measured from the standard deviation of the internally calibrated mean photometry for a given source, is 0.2 mmag at magnitude G=10 to 14, 0.8 mmag at G=17, and 2.6 mmag at G=19. The significant magnitude term found in the Gaia DR2 photometry is no longer visible, and overall there are no trends larger than 1 mmag/mag. Using one passband over the whole colour and magnitude range leaves no systematics above the 1\% level in magnitude in any of the bands, and a larger systematic is present for a very small sample of bright and blue sources. A detailed description of the residual systematic effects is provided. Overall the quality of the calibrated mean photometry in EDR3 is superior with respect to DR2 for all bands.},

CMC treats collisional stellar dynamics using H\textbackslash 'enon's method, where the cumulative effect of many two-body encounters is statistically reproduced as a single effective encounter between nearest-neighbor particles on a relaxation timescale. The star-by-star approach allows for the inclusion of additional physics, including strong gravitational three- and four-body encounters, two-body tidal and gravitational-wave captures, mass loss in arbitrary galactic tidal fields, and stellar evolution for both single and binary stars. The public release of CMC is pinned directly to the COSMIC population synthesis code, allowing dynamical star cluster simulations and population synthesis studies to be performed using identical assumptions about the stellar physics and initial conditions. As a demonstration, we present two examples of star cluster modeling: first, we perform the largest (\$N = 10\^8\$) star-by-star \$N\$-body simulation of a Plummer sphere evolving to core collapse, reproducing the expected self-similar density profile over more than 15 orders of magnitude; second, we generate realistic models for typical globular clusters, and we show that their dynamical evolution can produce significant numbers of black hole mergers with masses greater than those produced from isolated binary evolution (such as GW190521, a recently reported merger with component masses in the pulsational pair-instability mass gap).},

  abstract = {USNO-B1.0 and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) are the most widely used all-sky surveys. However, 2MASS has no proper motions at all, and USNO-B1.0 published only relative, not absolute (i.e., on the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRS), proper motions. We performed a new determination of mean positions and proper motions on the ICRS system by combining USNO-B1.0 and 2MASS astrometry. This catalog is called PPMXL (VO access to the catalog is possible via http://vo.uni-hd.de/ppmxl), and it aims to be completed from the brightest stars down to about V {$\approx$} 20 all sky. PPMXL contains about 900 million objects, some 410 million with 2MASS photometry, and is the largest collection of ICRS proper motions at present. As representative for the ICRS, we chose PPMX. The recently released UCAC3 could not be used because we found plate-dependent distortions in its proper motion system north of -20\textdegree{} declination. UCAC3 served as an intermediate system for {$\delta$} {$<$}= -20\textdegree. The resulting typical individual mean errors of the proper motions range from 4 mas yr-1 to more than 10 mas yr-1 depending on observational history. The mean errors of positions at epoch 2000.0 are 80-120 mas, if 2MASS astrometry could be used, 150-300 mas else. We also give correction tables to convert USNO-B1.0 observations of, e.g., minor planets to the ICRS system.},

  abstract = {Young stellar clusters harbour complex spatial structures emerging from the star formation process. Identifying stellar over-densities is a key step to constrain better how these structures are formed. The high accuracy of distances derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes yet do not allow to locate with certainty individual stars within clusters of size \$\textbackslash approx 1\textbackslash, \textbackslash rm\{pc\}\$. In this work, we explore how such uncertainty in distance estimates can lead to the misidentification of membership of sub-clusters selected by the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm. Our goal is to assess how this impacts their estimated properties. Using N-body simulations, we build Gravity-Driven Fragmentation (GDF) models that reproduce self-consistently the early stellar configurations of a star forming region. Stellar groups are then identified both in 3- and 2-dimensions by the MST algorithm, representing respectively an ideal and an inaccurate identification. We compare the properties derived of these resulting groups, to assess the systematic bias introduced by projection and incompleteness. We show that in such fragmented configurations, the dynamical mass of groups identified in projection is systematically underestimated compared to those of groups identified in 3D. This systematic error is statistically of \$50\textbackslash\%\$ for more than half of the groups and reach \$100\textbackslash\%\$ in a quarter of them. Adding incompleteness further increases this bias. These results challenge our ability to identify accurately sub-clusters in most nearby star forming regions where distance estimate uncertainties are comparable to the size of the region. New clump finding methods have to tackle this issue in order to define better the dynamical state of these substructures.},

For a small fraction of these sources the astrometric solutions are poor, and the reported values and uncertainties may not apply. For many analyses it is important to recognize and excise these spurious results, commonly done by means of quality flags in the Gaia catalog. Here we devise and apply a path to separating 'good' from 'bad' astrometric solutions that is an order-of-magnitude cleaner than any single flag: we achieve a purity of 99.7\% and a completeness of 97.6\% as validated on our test data. We devise an extensive sample of manifestly bad astrometric solutions: sources whose inferred parallax is 'negative' at {$>$}= 4.5 sigma; and a corresponding sample of presumably good solutions: the sources in HEALPix patches of the sky that do not contain extremely negative parallaxes. We then train a neural net that uses 14 pertinent Gaia catalog entries to discriminate these two samples, captured in a single 'astrometric fidelity' parameter. An extensive and diverse set of verification tests show that our approach to assessing astrometric fidelity works very cleanly also in the regime where no negative parallaxes are involved; its main limitations are in the very low S/N regime. Our astrometric fidelities for all EDR3 can be queried via the Virtual Observatory. In the spirit of open science, we make our code and training/validation data public, so that our results can be easily reproduced.},

We have generated our catalog (GeDR3mock) using galaxia, a tool to sample stars from an underlying Milky Way (MW) model or from N-body data. We used an updated Besan\textbackslash c\{c\}on Galactic model together with the latest PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, now also including white dwarfs. We added the Magellanic clouds and realistic open clusters with internal rotation. We empirically modelled uncertainties based on Gaia DR2 (GDR2) and scaled them according to the longer baseline in Gaia EDR3. The apparent magnitudes were reddened according to a new selection of 3D extinction maps. To help with the Gaia selection function we provide all-sky magnitude limit maps in G and BP for a few relevant GDR2 subsets together with the routines to produce these maps for user-defined subsets. We supplement the catalog with photometry and extinctions in non-Gaia bands. The catalog is available in the Virtual Observatory and can be queried just like the actual Gaia EDR3 will be. We highlight a few capabilities of the Astronomy Data Query Language (ADQL) with educative catalog queries. We use the data extracted from those queries to compare GeDR3mock to GDR2, which emphasises the importance of adding observational noise to the mock data. Since the underlying truth, e.g. stellar parameters, is know in GeDR3mock, it can be used to construct priors as well as mock data tests for parameter estimation. All code, models and data used to produce GeDR3mock are linked and contained in galaxia\_wrap, a python package, representing a fast galactic forward model, able to project MW models and N-body data into realistic Gaia observables.},

In order to overcome the extinction problem and the spatial limit of previous surveys, we use the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data to find clusters. We also use other infrared survey data in the archive for additional analysis. We find 923 new clusters, of which 202 clusters are embedded clusters. These clusters are concentrated toward the Galactic plane and show a symmetric distribution with respect to the Galactic latitude. The embedded clusters show a stronger concentration to the Galactic plane than the nonembedded clusters. The new clusters are found more in the first Galactic quadrant, while previously known clusters are found more in the fourth Galactic quadrant. The spatial distribution of the combined sample of known clusters and new clusters is approximately symmetric with respect to the Galactic longitude. We estimate reddenings, distances, and relative ages of the 15 class A clusters using theoretical isochrones. Ten of them are relatively old (age \&gt;800 Myr) and five are young (age {$\approx$}4 Myr).},

  abstract = {In this work we improve a previously published method to calculate in a reliable way the radius of an open cluster. The method is based on the behaviour of stars in the proper motion space as the sampling changes in the position space. Here we describe the new version of the method and show its performance and robustness. Additionally, we apply it to a large number of open clusters using data from Gaia DR2 to generate a catalogue of 401 clusters with reliable radius estimations. The range of obtained apparent radii goes from Rc=1.4+-0.1 arcmin (for the cluster FSR 1651) to Rc=25.5+-3.5 arcmin (for NGC\textasciitilde 2437). Cluster linear sizes follow very closely a lognormal distribution with a mean characteristic radius of Rc=3.7 pc, and its high radius tail can be fitted by a power law as N \textbackslash propto Rc\^(-3.11+-0.35). Additionally, we find that number of members, cluster radius and age follow the relationship Nc \textbackslash propto Rc\^(1.2+-0.1) Tc\^(-1.9+-0.4) where the younger and more extensive the cluster, the more members it presents. The proposed method is not sensitive to low density or irregular spatial distributions of stars and, therefore, is a good alternative or complementary procedure to calculate open cluster radii not having previous information on star memberships.},

The structural parameters were obtained from King and Elson et al. model fittings. Integrated magnitudes and masses (for a subsample) are also provided. The sample contains mostly low surface brightness clusters with distances between 4.5 and 6.5 kpc and between 1 and 6.5 kpc from the LMC and SMC centres, respectively. We analysed their spatial distribution and structural properties, comparing them with those of inner clusters. Half-light and Jacobi radii were estimated, allowing an evaluation of the Roche volume tidal filling. We found that: (i) for our sample of LMC clusters, the tidal radii are, on average, larger than those of inner clusters from previous studies; (ii) the core radii dispersion tends to be greater for LMC clusters located towards the southwest, with position angles of \$\textbackslash sim\$200 degrees and about \$\textbackslash sim\$5 degrees from the LMC centre, i.e., those LMC clusters nearer to the SMC; (iii) the core radius evolution for clusters with known age is similar to that of inner clusters; (iv) SMC clusters with galactocentric distances closer than 4 kpc are overfilling; (v) the recent Clouds collision did not leave marks on the LMC clusters' structure that our analysis could reveal.},

  abstract = {Canis Major OB1 (CMa OB1) is a Galactic stellar association with a very intriguing star-formation scenario. There are more than two dozen known star clusters in its line of sight, but it is not clear which ones are physically associated with CMa OB1. We use a clustering code that employs five-dimensional data from the Gaia DR2 catalogue to identify physical groups and obtain their astrometric parameters and, in addition, we use two different isochrone-fitting methods to estimate the ages of these groups. We find 15 stellar groups with distances between 570 and 1650 pc, including 10 previously known and five new open cluster candidates. Four groups, precisely the youngest ones ({$<$} 20 Myr), CMa05, CMa06, CMa07, and CMa08, are confirmed to be part of CMa OB1. We find that CMa08, a new cluster candidate, may be the progenitor cluster of runaway stars. CMa06 coincides with the well-studied CMa R1 star-forming region. While CMa06 is still forming stars, due to the remaining material of the molecular cloud associated with the Sh 2-262 nebula, CMa05, CMa07, and CMa08 seem to be in more evolved stages of evolution, with no recent star-forming activity. The properties of these CMa OB1 physical groups fit well in a monolithic scenario of star formation, with a common formation mechanism, and having suffered multiple episodes of star formation. This suggests that the hierarchical model alone, which explains the populations of other parts of the same association, is not sufficient to explain its whole formation history.},

Fifty percent of the young open clusters (age {$<$} 30 Myr) in the ``Catalogue of Open Cluster Data'' (COCD) have O-stars as members, or have ejected at least one O-star in the first 10 Myr of their life, or both. During this period the average mass loss from open clusters by ejecting O-stars is found to be 3 to 5 per Myr. We prove that \emph{{$\zeta<$}i/{$>$} Pup had its origin in the open cluster Trumpler 10 which it left about 2.5 Myr ago, and that its present-day distance is 300 pc (compared to 440 pc before). The revised distance implies a significant revision of the stellar parameters (a radius of 14 , a mass of 22.5 , and a luminosity of log of 5.74) i.e., \emph{{$\zeta<$}i/{$>$} Pup is closer, less massive, and less luminous than previously thought.

The MWSC data reduction pipeline involved the catalogue of positions and proper motions (PPMXL) on the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) and near-infrared photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). \emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}In the first extension to the MWSC, photometric filters were applied to the 2MASS catalogue to find new cluster candidates that were subsequently confirmed or rejected by the MWSC pipeline. To further extend the MWSC census, particularly of nearby clusters, we aimed at discovering new clusters by conducting an almost global search in proper motion catalogues as a starting point. \emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}We first selected high-quality samples from the PPMXL and the Fourth US Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC4) for comparison and verification of the proper motions. For 441 circular proper motion bins (radius 15 mas/yr) within {$\pm$}50 mas/yr, the sky outside a thin Galactic plane zone (| \emph{b{$<$}i/{$>$} | {$<$} 5\textdegree ) was binned in small areas (``sky pixels'') of 0.25 \texttimes{} 0.25 deg\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$}. Sky pixels with enhanced numbers of stars with a certain common proper motion in both catalogues were considered as cluster candidates. After visual inspection of the sky images, we built an automated procedure that combined these representations of the sky for neighbouring proper motion subsamples after a background correction. The 692 compact cluster candidates detected above a threshold that was equivalent to a minimum of 12 to 130 cluster stars in dependence on the Galactic latitude were then cross-checked with known star clusters and clusters of galaxies. New candidates served as input for the MWSC pipeline. \emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}About half of our candidates overlapped with known clusters (46 globular and 68 open clusters in the Galaxy, about 150 known clusters of galaxies) or the Magellanic Clouds. About 10\% of our candidates are 63 new open clusters confirmed by the MWSC pipeline. They predominantly occupy the two inner Galactic quadrants and have apparent sizes and numbers of highly probable members slightly larger than those of the typically small MWSC clusters, whereas their other parameters (ages, distances, tidal radii) fall in the typical ranges. As we searched for compact clusters, we did not find new very nearby (extended) clusters, and the mean total proper motion of the new 63 clusters is with 6.3 mas/yr similar to the MWSC average (5.5 mas/yr). Only four new clusters have mean proper motions between 10 mas/yr and our observed maximum of about 13 mas/yr.}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Atomic diffusion and mixing processes in stellar interiors influence the structure and the surface composition of stars. Some of these processes cannot yet be modelled from the first principles. This limits their applicability in stellar models used for studies of stellar populations and Galactic evolution. Our main goal is to put constrains on the stellar structure and evolution models using new refined measurements of chemical composition in stars of Galactic open cluster. We use medium-resolution, 19 200 {$<$}= R {$<$}= 21 500, optical spectra of the stars in the open cluster NGC 2420 obtained within the Gaia-ESO survey. The sample covers all evolutionary stages from the main-sequence to red giant branch. Stellar parameters are derived using a combined Bayesian analysis of spectra, 2MASS photometry, and astrometric data from Gaia DR2. The abundances of Mg, Ca, Fe, and Li are determined from non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) synthetic spectra, computed using one-dimensional (1D) and averaged three-dimensional (3D) model atmospheres. We compare our results with a grid of Code d'Evolution Stellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire (CESTAM) stellar evolution models, which include atomic diffusion, turbulent and rotational mixing. We find prominent evolutionary trends in the abundances of Fe, Ca, Mg, and Li with the mass of the stars in the cluster. Fe, Mg, and Ca show a depletion at the cluster turn-off, but the abundances gradually increase and flatten near the base of the RGB. The abundance trend for Li displays a signature of rotational mixing on the main-sequence and abrupt depletion on the subgiant branch, which is caused by advection of Li-poor material to the surface. The analysis of abundances combined with the CESTAM model predictions allows us to place limits on the parameter space of the models and to constrain the zone in the stellar interior where turbulent mixing takes place.},

We present a comprehensive study of an open star cluster, NGC2527, by combining data from XMM-UVOT-Gaia. Cluster membership of stars and their photometry are taken from Gaia and cross-matched with XMM and UVOT detections.

We detect 5 sub-subgiants and 5 bandgap stars, which defy single star evolution. We estimate the temperature, mass, radius, and luminosity of 53 single stars and 10 potential binary stars using a python code which fits single and composite Kurucz spectra to broad-band Spectral Energy Distribution. Among the 12 X-ray emitting members, we find 5 are potential RS CVn type binaries, 2 are potential FK Comae type of RGB stars, and 5 are main sequence (MS) stars with high coronal activity. Members with strong UV emission comprise of 1 RGB star, and several MS stars with UV excess suggestive of chromospheric activity. Based on comparison with other clusters, we tentatively suggest that X-ray luminosity of both RS CVn and contact binaries increases with age suggesting more active binaries are present in older clusters as compared to younger clusters. This study suggests the possible presence of W UMa and FK Comae type stars in younger (age\textasciitilde 630 Myr) clusters.},

  abstract = {We present the discovery and characterisation of an eclipsing binary identified by the Next Generation Transit Survey in the \$\textbackslash sim\$115 Myr old Blanco 1 open cluster. NGTS J0002-29 comprises three M dwarfs: a short-period binary and a companion in a wider orbit. This system is the first well-characterised, low-mass eclipsing binary in Blanco 1. With a low mass ratio, a tertiary companion and binary components that straddle the fully convective boundary, it is an important benchmark system, and one of only two well-characterised, low-mass eclipsing binaries at this age. We simultaneously model light curves from NGTS, TESS, SPECULOOS and SAAO, radial velocities from VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES, and the system's spectral energy distribution. We find that the binary components travel on circular orbits around their common centre of mass in \$P\_\{\textbackslash rm orb\} = 1.09800524 \textbackslash pm 0.00000038\$ days, and have masses \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm pri\}=0.3978\textbackslash pm 0.0033\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm sec\}=0.2245\textbackslash pm 0.0018\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, radii \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm pri\}=0.4037\textbackslash pm 0.0048\$ R\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm sec\}=0.2759\textbackslash pm 0.0055\$ R\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, and effective temperatures \$T\_\{\textbackslash rm pri\}=3372\textbackslash,\^\{+44\}\_\{-37\}\$ K and \$T\_\{\textbackslash rm sec\}=3231\textbackslash,\^\{+38\}\_\{-31\}\$ K. We compare these properties to the predictions of seven stellar evolution models, which typically imply an inflated primary. The system joins a list of 19 well-characterised, low-mass, sub-Gyr, stellar-mass eclipsing binaries, which constitute some of the strongest observational tests of stellar evolution theory at low masses and young ages.},

The weighted mean radial velocity of open clusters was determined, using the most probable members available from a previous astrometric investigation that also provided mean parallaxes and proper motions.

The velocity distribution of nearby clusters was investigated, as well as the spatial and velocity distributions of the whole sample as a function of age. A high-quality subsample was used to investigate some possible pairs and groups of clusters sharing the same Galactic position and velocity.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. For the high-quality sample of 406 clusters, the median uncertainty of the weighted mean radial velocity is 0.5 km s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}. The accuracy, assessed by comparison to ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy, is better than 1 km s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}. Open clusters nicely follow the velocity distribution of field stars in the close solar neighbourhood as previously revealed by \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2. As expected, the vertical distribution of young clusters is very flat, but the novelty is the high precision to which this can be seen. The dispersion of vertical velocities of young clusters is at the level of 5 km s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}. Clusters older than 1 Gyr span distances to the Galactic plane of up to 1 kpc with a vertical velocity dispersion of 14 km s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, typical of the thin disc. Five pairs of clusters and one group with five members might be physically related. Other binary candidates that have been identified previously are found to be chance alignments.}}}}}}}}}}}}},

We apply the method to analyse NGC 6752, using Dartmouth stellar evolutionary models. Assuming a single stellar population, we derive an age of \$13.7\textbackslash pm0.5\$ Gyr and a distance of \$d\_\{\textbackslash odot\}=4.11\textbackslash pm 0.08\$ kpc, with the latter in agreement within \$\textasciitilde 3\textbackslash sigma\$ with the inverse Gaia parallax.

These fractions are in good agreement with the literature. An age difference of \$500\textbackslash pm410\$ Myr between the first and the third generation is found, with the uncertainty decreasing to \$400\$ Myr when the helium enhancement is taken into account.},

  abstract = {The chemical makeup of a star provides the fossil information of the environment where it formed. Under this premise, it should be possible to use chemical abundances to tag stars that formed within the same stellar association. This idea - known as chemical tagging - has not produced the expected results, especially within the thin disk where open stellar clusters have chemical patterns that are difficult to disentangle. The ultimate goal of this study is to probe the feasibility of chemical tagging within the thin disk population using high-quality data from a controlled sample of stars. We also aim at improving the existing techniques of chemical tagging and giving guidance on different strategies of clustering analysis in the elemental abundance space. Here we develop the first blind search of open clusters' members through clustering analysis in the elemental abundance space using the OPTICS algorithm applied to data from the Gaia-ESO survey. First, we evaluate different strategies of analysis, determining which ones are more performing. Second, we apply these methods to a data set including both field stars and open clusters attempting a blind recover of as many open clusters as possible. We show how specific strategies of data analysis can improve the final results. Specifically, we demonstrate that open clusters can be more efficaciously recovered with the Manhattan metric and on a space whose dimensions are carefully selected. Using these (and other) prescriptions we are able to recover open clusters hidden in our data set and find new members of these stellar associations. Our results indicate that there are chances of recovering open clusters' members via clustering analysis in the elemental abundance space. Presumably, the performances of chemical tagging will further increase with higher quality data and more sophisticated clustering algorithms.},

According to our membership analysis based on \textbackslash textit\{Gaia\} astrometry, out of the 226 potential clusters falling in the footprint of GALAH or APOGEE, we find that 205 have secure members that were observed by at least one of the survey. Furthermore, members of 134 clusters have high-quality spectroscopic data that we use to determine their chemical composition. We leverage this information to study the chemical distribution throughout the Galactic disk of 21 elements, from C to Eu, and including Fe. The radial metallicity gradient obtained from our analysis is \$-\$0.076\$\textbackslash pm\$0.009 dex kpc\$\^\{-1\}\$, which is in agreement with previous works based on smaller samples. Furthermore, the gradient in the [Fe/H] - guiding radius (r\$\_\{\textbackslash rm guid\}\$) plane is \$-\$0.073\$\textbackslash pm\$0.008 dex kpc\$\^\{-1\}\$. We also reveal trends in the [X/Fe] - r\$\_\{\textbackslash rm guid\}\$ - age space, which are important to understand production rates of different elements as a function of space and time. Finally, we observe subtle - but significant - differences on how field stars and open clusters trace the distribution of chemical elements throughout the Galactic disk. As it is discussed in the paper, these differences are probably due to the physical selection effect imposed by our Galaxy, which preserves the clusters living far from its gravitational potential perturbations (e.g., spirals, bars, molecular clouds), while it destroys all the others.},

The model is a convolutional neural network that learns to embed images into a low dimensional latent space, and simultaneously optimises a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) on the embedded vectors to cluster the training data. By utilising variational inference, we are able to use the learned GMM as a statistical prior on the latent space to facilitate random sampling and generation of synthetic images. We demonstrate AstroVaDEr's capabilities by training it on gray-scaled \textbackslash textit\{gri\} images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, using a sample of galaxies that are classified by Galaxy Zoo 2. An unsupervised clustering model is found which separates galaxies based on learned morphological features such as axis ratio, surface brightness profile and orientation. We use the learned mixture model to generate synthetic images of galaxies based on the morphological profiles of the Gaussian components. AstroVaDEr demonstrates the ability to classify the morphology of galaxies in a human-interpretable way without the need for labelled training data. The network is scalable and flexible, allowing for larger datasets to be classified, or different kinds of imaging data. We also demonstrate the generative properties of the model, which allow for realistic synthetic images of galaxies to be sampled from the learned classification scheme. These can be used to create synthetic image catalogs or to perform image processing tasks such as deblending.},

  abstract = {Open Clusters (OCs) can trace with a great accuracy the evolution of the Galactic disk. The aim of this work is to study the kinematical behavior of the OC population over time. We take advantage of the latest age determinations of OCs to investigate the correlations of the 6D phase space coordinates and orbital properties with age. We also investigate the rotation curve of the Milky Way traced by OCs and we compare it to that of other observational or theoretical studies. We gathered nearly 30000 Radial Velocity (RV) measurements of OC members from both Gaia-RVS data and ground based surveys and catalogues. We computed the weighted mean RV, Galactic velocities and orbital parameters of 1382 OCs. We investigated their distributions as a function of age, and by comparison to field stars. We provide the largest RV catalogue available for OCs, half of it based on at least 3 members. Compared to field stars, we note that OCs are not exactly on the same arches in the radial-azimuthal velocity plane, while they seem to follow the same diagonal ridges in the Galactic radial distribution of azimuthal velocities. Velocity ellipsoids in different age bins all show a clear anisotropy. The heating rate of the OC population is similar to that of field stars for the radial and azimuthal components but significantly lower for the vertical component. The rotation curve drawn by our sample of clusters shows several dips, which match the wiggles derived from non-axisymmetric models of the Galaxy. From the computation of orbits, we obtain a clear dependence of the maximum height and eccentricity with age. Finally, the orbital characteristics of the sample of clusters as shown by the action variables, follow the distribution of field stars. The additional age information of the clusters points towards some (weak) age dependence of the known moving groups.},

The analysis of structural parameters of OCs as a function of their age and position in the Galaxy brings constraints on theoretical models of cluster evolution. The Gaia catalogue is very appropriate to find members of OCs at large distance from their centers. We aim at revisiting the membership lists of OCs from the solar vicinity, in particular by extending these membership lists to the peripheral areas thanks to Gaia EDR3. We used the clustering algorithm HDBSCAN on Gaia parallaxes and proper motions to systematically look for members up to 50 pc from the cluster centers. We fitted a King's function on the radial density profile of these clusters and a Gaussian Mixture Model on their two dimensional distribution of members. We also evaluated the degree of mass segregation of the clusters. Our methodology performs well on 389 clusters out of the 467 selected ones. We report the detection of vast coronae around almost all the clusters and the detection of 71 OCs with tidal tails, multiplying by more than four the number of such structures identified. We find the size of the cores to be on average smaller for old clusters than for young ones. Also, the overall size of the clusters seems to slightly increase with age while the fraction of stars in the halo seems to decrease. As expected the mass segregation is more pronounced in the oldest clusters but a clear trend with age is not seen. OCs are more extended than previously expected, regardless of their age. The decrease in the proportion of stars populating the clusters halos highlights the different cluster evaporation processes and the short timescales they need to affect the clusters. Reported parameters all depend on cluster ages but can not be described as single functions of time.},

The average distance of this structure is about 310\textbackslash,pc from us. Both the length and width are over 200\textbackslash,pc, but the thickness is only about 80\textbackslash,pc. The "snake" has one tail and two dissolving cores, which can be clearly distinguished in the 6D phase space. The whole structure includes thousands of members with a total mass of larger than 2000\textbackslash,\$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ in an uniform population. The population is so young that it can not be well explained with the classical theory of tidal tails. We therefore suspect that the "snake" is hierarchically primordial, rather than the result of dynamically tidal stripping, even if the "snake" is probably expanding. The coherent 5D phase information and the ages suggest that the "snake" was probably born in the same environment as the filamentary structure of Beccari et al.(2020). If so, the "snake" could extend the sky region of the Vela OB2 association by a factor of \$\textbackslash sim 2\$, and supplement the census of its coeval structures. This finding is useful to understand the history of the formation and evolution of the Vela OB2 complex. The age of the "snake" well matches with that of the Gould Belt.

In the very first phases of their life, these stars are expected to interact with the surrounding environment, before being released to the field when the cluster is tidally disrupted by the host galaxy. We present a set of N-body simulations to describe the evolution of young stellar clusters and their binary content in the first phases of their life. To do this, we have developed a method that generates realistic initial conditions for binary stars in star clusters from hydrodynamical simulations. We considered different evolutionary cases to quantify the impact of binary and stellar evolution. Also, we compared their evolution to that of King and fractal models with different length scales. Our results indicate that the global expansion of the cluster from hydrodynamical simulations is initially balanced by the sub-clump motion and accelerates when a monolithic shape is reached, as in a post-core collapse evolution. Compared to the spherical initial conditions, the ratio of the 50\% to 10\% Lagrangian radius shows a very distinctive trend, explained by the formation of a hot core of massive stars triggered by the high initial degree of mass segregation. As for its binary population, each cluster shows a self-regulating behaviour by creating interacting binaries with binding energies of the order of its energy scales. Also, in absence of original binaries, the dynamically formed binaries present a mass dependent binary fraction, that mimics the trend of the observed one.},

This implies that BHs should be retained even in open clusters with low escape velocities (\$\textbackslash lesssim1\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{km \textbackslash, s\^\{-1\}\}\$). We search for signatures of the presence of BHs in the nearest open cluster to the Sun - the Hyades - by comparing density profiles of direct \$N\$-body models to data from \$Gaia\$. The observations are best reproduced by models with \$2-3\$ BHs at present. Models that never possessed BHs have an half-mass radius \$\textbackslash sim30\textbackslash\%\$ smaller than the observed value, while those where the last BHs were ejected recently (\$\textbackslash lesssim150\textasciitilde\$Myr ago) can still reproduce the density profile. In 50\% of the models hosting BHs, we find BHs with stellar companion(s). Their period distribution peaks at \$\textbackslash sim10\^3\$ yr, making them unlikely to be found through velocity variations. We look for potential BH companions through large \$Gaia\$ astrometric and spectroscopic errors, identifying 56 binary candidates - none of which consistent with a massive compact companion. Models with \$2-3\$ BHs have an elevated central velocity dispersion, but observations can not yet discriminate. We conclude that the present-day structure of the Hyades requires a significant fraction of BHs to receive natal kicks smaller than the escape velocity of \$\textbackslash sim 3\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{km \textbackslash, s\^\{-1\}\}\$ at the time of BH formation and that the nearest BHs to the Sun are in, or near, Hyades.},

We use Gaia DR2 data to determine accurate stellar membership for four intermediate-age open clusters, Melotte 66, NGC 2158, NGC 2506 and NGC 6819, and three old open clusters, Berkeley 39, NGC 188 and NGC 6791, to subsequently study their BSS populations. The BSS radial distributions of five clusters, Melotte 66, NGC 188, NGC 2158, NGC 2506, and NGC 6791, show bimodal distributions, placing them with Family II globular clusters which are of intermediate dynamical ages. The location of minima, \$r\_\textbackslash mathrm\{\{min\}\}\$, in the bimodal BSS radial distributions, varies from 1.5\$r\_c\$ to 4.0\$r\_c\$, where \$r\_c\$ is the core radius of the clusters. We find a positive correlation between \$r\_\textbackslash mathrm\{\{min\}\}\$ and \$N\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{relax\}\}\$, the ratio of cluster age to the current central relaxation time of the cluster. We further report that this correlation is consistent in its slope, within the errors, to the slope of the globular cluster correlation between the same quantities, but with a slightly higher intercept. This is the first example in open clusters that shows BSS radial distributions as efficient probes of dynamical age. The BSS radial distributions of the remaining two clusters, Berkeley 39 and NGC 6819, are flat. The estimated \$N\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{relax\}\}\$ values of these two clusters, however, indicate that they are dynamically evolved. Berkeley 39 especially has its entire BSS population completely segregated to the inner regions of the cluster.},

  abstract = {[...] This paper presents a rigorous derivation of a goodness-of-fit statistics for colour-magnitude diagrams (CMD). We discuss the reliability of the underlying assumptions and their validity. We derived the distribution of the sum of squared Mahalanobis distances of stellar data and theoretical isochrone for a generic set of data and models. We applied this to the case of synthetic CMDs constructed to mimic real data of open clusters in the GAIA sample. We analysed the capability of distinguishing among different sets of input physics and parameters that were used to compute the stellar models. We generated synthetic clusters from isochrones computed with these perturbed quantities, and we evaluated the goodness-of-fit with respect to the unperturbed isochrone. We show that when \$r\$ magnitudes are available for each of the \$N\$ observational objects and \$p\$ hyperparameters are estimated in the fit, the error distribution follows a \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ distribution with \$(r-1)N - p\$ degrees of freedom. We show that the linearisation of the isochrone causes negligible deviation from this result. We investigated the possibility of detecting the effects on stellar models that are induced when varying convective core overshooting efficiency, \$\^\{14\}\$N\$(p,\textbackslash gamma)\^\{15\}\$O reaction rate, microscopic diffusion velocities, outer BCs, and colour transformation. The results suggest that it is possible to detect the effect induced by only some of the perturbed quantities. [...] A variation in the convective core overshooting efficiency was detectable only for photometric errors of 0.003 mag and only for the 1 Gyr case. The effects induced by the outer boundary conditions and the bolometric corrections are the largest. [...] As a last exercise, we addressed the validity of the goodness-of-fit statistics for real-world open cluster CMDs, contaminated by field stars or unresolved binaries. [...]},

Our goal is to extend current open cluster membership lists with faint members and to characterise the low-mass end, which members are important for many applications, in particular for ground-based spectroscopic surveys. We use a deep neural network architecture to learn the distribution of highly reliable open cluster member stars around known clusters. After that, we use the trained network to estimate new open cluster members based on their similarities in a high-dimensional space, five-dimensional astrometry plus the three photometric bands. Due to the improved astrometric precisions of Gaia DR3 with respect to DR2, we are able to homogeneously detect new faint member stars (G {$>$} 18) for the known open cluster population. Our methodology can provide extended membership lists for open clusters down to the limiting magnitude of Gaia, which will enable further studies to characterise the open cluster population, e.g. estimation of their masses, or their dynamics. These extended membership lists are also ideal target lists for forthcoming ground-based spectroscopic surveys.},

At the same time, we use the selection of cluster members to explore the reliability and limitations of the Gaia catalogue itself. We find that the formal uncertainties on parallax and PM are underestimated by 10-20\% in dense central regions even for stars that pass numerous quality filters. We explore the the spatial covariance function of systematic errors, and determine a lower limit on the uncertainty of average parallaxes and PM at the level 0.01 mas and 0.025 mas/yr, respectively. Finally, a comparison of mean parallaxes of clusters with distances from various literature sources suggests that the parallaxes (after applying the zero-point correction suggested by Lindegren et al. 2020) are overestimated by 0.006-0.009 mas. Despite these caveats, the quality of Gaia astrometry has been significantly improved in EDR3 and provides valuable insights into the properties of star clusters.},

  abstract = {The last decade has seen a revolution in our knowledge of the Galaxy thanks to the Gaia and asteroseismic space missions and the ground-based spectroscopic surveys. To complete this picture, it is necessary to map the ages of its stellar populations. During recent years, the dependence on time of abundance ratios involving slow (s) neutron-capture and \$\textbackslash alpha\$ elements (called chemical-clocks) has been used to provide estimates of stellar ages, usually in a limited volume close to the Sun. We aim to analyse the relations of chemical clocks in the Galactic disc extending the range to R\$\_\{\textbackslash rm GC\}\textbackslash sim\$6-20\textasciitilde kpc. Using the sixth internal data release of the Gaia-ESO survey, we calibrated several relations between stellar ages and abundance ratios [s/\$\textbackslash alpha\$] using a sample of open clusters, the largest one so far used with this aim. Thanks to their wide galactocentric coverage, we investigated the radial variations of the shape of these relations, confirming their non-universality. We estimated our accuracy and precision in recovering the global ages of open clusters, and the ages of their individual members. We applied the multi-variate relations with the highest correlation coefficients to the field star population. We confirm that there is no single age-chemical clock relationship valid for the whole disc, but that there is a dependence on the galactocentric position, which is related to the radial variation of the star formation history combined with the non-monotonic dependence on metallicity of the yields of the s-process elements from low- and intermediate-mass stars. Finally, the abundance ratios [Ba/\$\textbackslash alpha\$] are more sensitive to age than those with [Y/\$\textbackslash alpha\$] for young disc stars, and their slopes vary less with galactocentric distance.},

  abstract = {We analyze proper motions from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the second Gaia data release along with line-of-sight velocities from the MUSE spectrograph to detect imprints of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the center of the nearby, core-collapsed, globular cluster NGC 6397. For this, we use the new MAMPOSST-PM Bayesian mass-modeling code, along with updated estimates of the surface density profile of NGC 6397. We consider different priors on velocity anisotropy and on the size of the central mass, and we also separate the stars into components of different mean mass to allow for mass segregation. The velocity ellipsoid is very isotropic throughout the cluster, as expected in post-core collapsed clusters subject to as strong a Galactic tidal field as NGC 6397. There is strong evidence for a central dark component of 0.8 to 2\% of the total mass of the cluster. However, we find robust evidence disfavoring a central IMBH in NGC 6397, preferring instead a diffuse dark inner subcluster of unresolved objects with a total mass of 1000 to 2000 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}, half of which is concentrated within 6 arcsec (2\% of the stellar effective radius). These results require the combination of HST and Gaia data: HST for the inner diagnostics and Gaia for the outer surface density and velocity anisotropy profiles. The small effective radius of the diffuse dark component suggests that it is composed of compact stars (white dwarfs and neutron stars) and stellar-mass black holes, whose inner locations are caused by dynamical friction given their high progenitor masses. We show that stellar-mass black holes should dominate the mass of this diffuse dark component, unless more than 25\% escape from the cluster. Their mergers in the cores of core-collapsed globular clusters could be an important source of the gravitational wave events detected by LIGO.},

We therefore couple the magnetohydrodynamics code FLASH to the N-body code ph4 and the stellar evolution code SeBa using the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE) to model stellar dynamics, evolution, and collisional N-body dynamics and the formation of binary and higher-order multiple systems, while implementing stellar feedback in the form of radiation, stellar winds and supernovae in FLASH. We here describe the algorithms used for each of these processes. We denote this integrated package Torch. We then use this novel numerical method to simulate the formation and early evolution of several examples of open clusters of \textasciitilde 1000 stars formed from clouds with a mass range of 10\^3-10\^5 M\_sun. Analyzing the effects of stellar feedback on the gas and stars of the natal clusters, we find that in these examples, the stellar clusters are resilient to disruption, even in the presence of intense feedback. This can even slightly increase the amount of dense, Jeans unstable gas by sweeping up shells; thus, a stellar wind strong enough to trap its own H II region shows modest triggering of star formation. Our clusters are born moderately mass segregated, an effect enhanced by feedback, and retained after the ejection of their natal gas, in agreement with observations.},

They are composed of stars of nearly equal age and chemical composition, allowing us to use them as chronometers and as testbeds for gauging stellar evolution. It has become clear recently that massive stars are formed preferentially in close binaries, in which mass transfer will drastically change the evolution of the stars. This is expected to leave a significant imprint in the distribution of cluster stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Our results, based on a dense model grid of more than 50 000 detailed binary evolution calculations, indeed show several distinct, coeval main-sequence components, most notably an extended main-sequence turn-off region, and a group of near-critically rotating stars that is spread over a large luminosity range on the red side of the classical main sequence. We comprehensively demonstrate the time evolution of the features in an animation, and we derive analytic expressions to describe these features. We find quantitative agreement with results based on recent photometric and spectroscopic observations. We conclude that while other factors may also be at play, binary evolution has a major impact on the main-sequence morphology of young star clusters.},

Based on their distribution in the CMD, we show that stars of the blue MS component can be understood as slow rotators originating from stellar mergers. We derive the masses of the blue MS stars, and find that they follow a nearly flat mass function, which supports their unusual formation path. Our results imply that the cluster stars gain their mass in two different ways, by disk accretion leading to rapid rotation, contributing to the red MS, or by binary merger leading to slow rotation and populating the blue MS. We also derive the approximate merger time of the individual stars of the blue MS component, and find a strong early peak in the merger rate, with a lower level merger activity prevailing for tens of Myr. This supports recent binary formation models, and explains new velocity dispersion measurements for members of young star clusters. Our findings shed new light on the origin of the bi-modal mass, spin, and magnetic field distributions of main-sequence stars.},

  abstract = {Historically, it has often been asserted that most stars form in compact clusters. In this scenario, present-day gravitationally-unbound OB associations are the result of the expansion of initially gravitationally-bound star clusters. However, this paradigm is inconsistent with recent results, both theoretical and observational, that instead favour a hierarchical picture of star formation in which stars are formed across a continuous distribution of gas densities and most OB associations never were bound clusters. Instead they are formed in-situ as the low-density side of this distribution, rather than as the remnants of expanding clusters. We utilise the second \$Gaia\$ data release to quantify the degree to which OB associations are undergoing expansion and, therefore, whether OB associations are the product of expanding clusters, or whether they were born in-situ, as the large-scale, globally-unbound associations that we see today. We find that the observed kinematic properties of associations are consistent with highly substructured velocity fields and additionally require some degree of localised expansion from sub-clusters within the association. While most present-day OB associations do exhibit low levels of expansion, there is no significant correlation between radial velocity and radius. Therefore, the large-scale structure of associations is not set by the expansion of clusters, rather it is a relic of the molecular gas cloud from which the association was formed. This finding is inconsistent with a monolithic model of association formation and instead favours a hierarchical model, in which OB associations form in-situ, following the fractal structure of the gas from which they form.},

Unfortunately, due to the large number of weights, all the examples in a mini-batch typically share the same weight perturbation, thereby limiting the variance reduction effect of large mini-batches. We introduce flipout, an efficient method for decorrelating the gradients within a mini-batch by implicitly sampling pseudo-independent weight perturbations for each example. Empirically, flipout achieves the ideal linear variance reduction for fully connected networks, convolutional networks, and RNNs. We find significant speedups in training neural networks with multiplicative Gaussian perturbations. We show that flipout is effective at regularizing LSTMs, and outperforms previous methods. Flipout also enables us to vectorize evolution strategies: in our experiments, a single GPU with flipout can handle the same throughput as at least 40 CPU cores using existing methods, equivalent to a factor-of-4 cost reduction on Amazon Web Services.},

These large numbers motivated the development of a more objective and repeatable method to help perform source classifications. In this paper we consider the results for five PHANGS-HST galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1433, NGC 1566, NGC 3351, NGC 3627) using classifications from two convolutional neural network architectures (RESNET and VGG) trained using deep transfer learning techniques. The results are compared to classifications performed by humans. The primary result is that the neural network classifications are comparable in quality to the human classifications with typical agreement around 70 to 80\$\textbackslash\%\$ for Class 1 clusters (symmetric, centrally concentrated) and 40 to 70\$\textbackslash\%\$ for Class 2 clusters (asymmetric, centrally concentrated). If Class 1 and 2 are considered together the agreement is 82 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 3\$\textbackslash\%\$. Dependencies on magnitudes, crowding, and background surface brightness are examined. A detailed description of the criteria and methodology used for the human classifications is included along with an examination of systematic differences between PHANGS-HST and LEGUS. The distribution of data points in a colour-colour diagram is used as a 'figure of merit' to further test the relative performances of the different methods. The effects on science results (e.g., determinations of mass and age functions) of using different cluster classification methods are examined and found to be minimal.},

  abstract = {Planet formation is generally described in terms of a system containing the host star and a protoplanetary disc, of which the internal properties (e.g. mass and metallicity) determine the properties of the resulting planetary system. However, (proto)planetary systems are predicted and observed to be affected by the spatially-clustered stellar formation environment, either through dynamical star-star interactions or external photoevaporation by nearby massive stars. It is challenging to quantify how the architecture of planetary systems is affected by these environmental processes, because stellar groups spatially disperse within {$<$}1 billion years, well below the ages of most known exoplanets. Here we identify old, co-moving stellar groups around exoplanet host stars in the astrometric data from the Gaia satellite and demonstrate that the architecture of planetary systems exhibits a strong dependence on local stellar clustering in position-velocity phase space, implying a dependence on their formation or evolution environment. After controlling for host stellar age, mass, metallicity, and distance from the Sun, we obtain highly significant differences (with \$p\$-values of \$10\^\{-5\}\{-\}10\^\{-2\}\$) in planetary (system) properties between phase space overdensities and the field. The median semi-major axis and orbital period of planets in overdensities are 0.087 au and 9.6 days, respectively, compared to 0.81 au and 154 days for planets around field stars. 'Hot Jupiters' (massive, close-in planets) predominantly exist in stellar phase space overdensities, strongly suggesting that their extreme orbits originate from environmental perturbations rather than internal migration or planet-planet scattering. Our findings reveal that stellar clustering is a key factor setting the architectures of planetary systems.},

  abstract = {We derive an accurate mass estimator for dispersion-supported stellar systems and demonstrate its validity by analysing resolved line-of-sight velocity data for globular clusters, dwarf galaxies and elliptical galaxies. Specifically, by manipulating the spherical Jeans equation we show that the mass enclosed within the 3D deprojected half-light radius r1/2 can be determined with only mild assumptions about the spatial variation of the stellar velocity dispersion anisotropy as long as the projected velocity dispersion profile is fairly flat near the half-light radius, as is typically observed. We find M1/2= 3 G-1{$\langle\sigma$}2los{$\rangle$}r1/2{$\simeq$} 4 G-1{$\langle\sigma$}2los{$\rangle$}Re, where {$\langle\sigma$}2los{$\rangle$} is the luminosity-weighted square of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and Re is the 2D projected half-light radius. While deceptively familiar in form, this formula is not the virial theorem, which cannot be used to determine accurate masses unless the radial profile of the total mass is known a priori. We utilize this finding to show that all of the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (MW dSphs) are consistent with having formed within a halo of a mass of approximately 3 \texttimes{} 109 M{$\odot$}, assuming a {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmology. The faintest MW dSphs seem to have formed in dark matter haloes that are at least as massive as those of the brightest MW dSphs, despite the almost five orders of magnitude spread in luminosity between them. We expand our analysis to the full range of observed dispersion-supported stellar systems and examine their dynamical I-band mass-to-light ratios {$\Upsilon$}I1/2. The {$\Upsilon$}I1/2 versus M1/2 relation for dispersion-supported galaxies follows a U shape, with a broad minimum near {$\Upsilon$}I1/2{$\simeq$} 3 that spans dwarf elliptical galaxies to normal ellipticals, a steep rise to {$\Upsilon$}I1/2{$\simeq$} 3200 for ultra-faint dSphs and a more shallow rise to {$\Upsilon$}I1/2{$\simeq$} 800 for galaxy cluster spheroids.}

  abstract = {In the currently favored cosmological paradigm galaxies form hierarchically through the accretion of numerous satellite galaxies. Since the satellites are much less massive than the host halo, they occupy a small fraction of the volume in action space defined by the potential of the host halo. Since actions are conserved when the potential of the host halo changes adiabatically, stars from an accreted satellite are expected to remain clustered in action space as the host halo evolves. In this paper, we identify accreted satellites in three Milky Way like disk galaxies from the cosmological baryonic FIRE-2 simulations by tracking satellite galaxies through simulation snapshots. We then try to recover these satellites by applying the cluster analysis algorithm Enlink to the orbital actions of accreted star particles in the present-day snapshot. We define several metrics to quantify the success of the clustering algorithm and use these metrics to identify well-recovered and poorly-recovered satellites. We plot these satellites in the infall time-progenitor mass (or stellar mass) space, and determine the boundaries between the well-recovered and poorly-recovered satellites in these two spaces with classification tree method. The groups found by Enlink are more likely to correspond to a real satellite if they have high significance, a quantity assigned by Enlink. Since cosmological simulations predict that most stellar halos have a population of insitu stars, we test the ability of Enlink to recover satellites when the sample is contaminated by 10-50\% of insitu star particles, and show that most of the satellites well-recovered by Enlink in the absence of insitu stars, stay well-recovered even with 50\% contamination. We thus expect that, in the future, cluster analysis in action space will be useful in upcoming data sets (e.g. Gaia) for identifying accreted satellites in the Milky Way.},

In particular, we focus on massive (\$10\^7 \textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) and young (40-Myr old) GCs. We consider stellar winds from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, ram pressure, gas accretion onto the cluster, and photoionisation feedback of binary stars. We find that the stellar luminosity is strong enough to warm and ionise the intracluster medium, but it does not lead to a significant gas expulsion. The cluster can thus retain the ejecta of AGB stars and the accreted pristine gas. In addition, efficient cooling occurs in the central region of the cluster within \$50 \textbackslash mathrm\{Myr\}\$ from the formation of first generation stars, leading to the formation of SG stars. Our results indicate that the inclusion of photoionisation does not suppress SG formation, but rather delays it by about \$\textbackslash sim10 \textbackslash mathrm\{Myr\}\$. The time delay depends on the density of the pristine gas, so that a denser medium exhibits a shorter delay in star formation. Moreover, photoionisation leads to a modest decrease in the total SG mass, compared to a model without it.},

UBVI photometry is employed in tandem with Gaia DR2 data to investigate the 3 dimensional structure and the star formation history of the region. By combining parallaxes and proper motions we identify 7 physical groups located between the young open cluster NGC 6231 and the bright nebula IC4628. The most prominent group coincides with the sparse open cluster Trumpler 24. We confirm the presence of the intermediate age star cluster VdB-Hagen 202, which is unexpected in this environment, and provide for the first time estimates of its fundamental parameters. After assessing individual groups membership, we derive mean proper motion components, distances, and ages. The seven groups belong to two different families. To the younger family (family I) belong several pre-Main Sequence stars as well. These are evenly spread across the field, and also in front of VdB-Hagen 202. VdB-Hagen 202 and two smaller, slightly detached, groups of similar properties form family II, which do not belong to the association, but are caught in the act of passing through it. As for the younger population, this forms an arc-like structure from the bright nebula IC 4628 down to NGC 6231, as previously found. Moreover, the pre-Main Sequence stars density seems to increase from NGC 6231 northward to Trumpler 24.},

  abstract = {Most measurements of mass in Astronomy that use kinematics of stars or gas rely on assumptions of equilibrium that are often hard to verify. Instead, we develop a novel idea that uses the clustering in action space, as a probe of underlying gravitational potential: the correct potential should maximize small-scale clustering in the action space. We provide a first-principle derivation of likelihood using the two-point correlation function in action space, and test it against simulations of stellar streams. We then apply this method to the 2nd data release of Gaia, and use it to measure the radial force fraction \$f\_h\$ and logarithmic slope \$\textbackslash alpha\$ of dark matter halo profile. We investigate stars within 9-11 kpc and 11.5-15 kpc from Galactic centre, and find \$(f\_h,\textbackslash alpha)= (0.391\textbackslash pm 0.009, 1.835\textbackslash pm 0.092) \$ and \$(0.351\textbackslash pm 0.012,1.687\textbackslash pm 0.079)\$, respectively. We also confirm that the set of parameters that maximize the likelihood function do correspond to the most clustering in the action space. The best-fit circular velocity curve for Milky Way potential is consistent with past measurements (although it is \$\textbackslash sim\$ 5-10\textbackslash\% lower than previous methods that use masers or globular clusters). Our work provides a clear demonstration of the full statistical power that lies in the full phase space information, relieving the need for \{\textbackslash it ad hoc\} assumptions such as virial equilibrium, circular motion, or steam-finding algorithms.},

  abstract = {In deep near-infrared imaging of the low-metallicity (\$\{\textbackslash rm [O/H]\}=-0.7\$ dex) H II region Sh 2-127 (S127) with Subaru/MOIRCS, we detected two young clusters with 413 members (S127A) in a slightly extended H II region and another with 338 members (S127B) in a compact H II region. The limiting magnitude was \$K=21.3\$ mag (10\$\textbackslash sigma\$), corresponding to a mass detection limit of \$\textbackslash sim\$0.2 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$. These clusters are an order of magnitude larger than previously studied young low-metallicity clusters and larger than the majority of solar neighborhood young clusters. Fits to the K-band luminosity functions indicate very young cluster ages of 0.5 Myr for S127A and 0.1-0.5 Myr for S127B, consistent with the large extinction (up to \$A\_V\textbackslash simeq20\$ mag) from thick molecular clouds and the presence of a compact H II region and class I source candidates, and suggest that the initial mass function (IMF) of the low-metallicity clusters is indistinguishable from typical solar neighborhood IMFs. Disk fractions of \$28\textbackslash\% \textbackslash pm 3\textbackslash\%\$ for S127A and \$40\textbackslash\% \textbackslash pm 4\textbackslash\%\$ for S127B are significantly lower than those of similarly aged solar neighborhood clusters (\$\textbackslash sim\$50\$\textbackslash\%\$-60\$\textbackslash\%\$). The disk fraction for S127B is higher than those of previously studied low-metallicity clusters (\${$<\$$}30 \$\textbackslash\%\$), probably due to S127B's age. This suggests that a large fraction of very young stars in low-metallicity environments have disks, but the disks are lost on a very short timescale. These results are consistent with our previous studies of low-metallicity star-forming regions, suggesting that a solar neighborhood IMF and low disk fraction are typical characteristics for low-metallicity regions, regardless of cluster scales.},

Star counts indicate the cluster has a core radius of 33.3 arcmin and a tidal radius of 137.5 arcmin. The cluster also possesses an extended corona, which cannot be reproduced by a simple King model. We computed the present-day cluster mass using its luminosity and mass function, and derived an estimate of 234 {$\pm$} 52 M {$\odot$}. We also estimated the cluster original mass using available recipes extracted from N-body simulations obtaining a mass at birth of 50,000 {$\pm$} 6500 M {$\odot$}. Therefore dynamical mass loss, mostly caused by tidal interaction with the Milky Way, reduced the cluster mass by about 99\%.

We adopt a hierarchical clustering algorithm that uses the celestial coordinates and the proper motions of the stars in the field of view of the cluster to estimate a proxy of the pairwise binding energy of the stars and arrange them in a binary tree. The cluster substructures and their members are identified by trimming the tree at two thresholds, according to the \$\textbackslash sigma\$-plateau method. Testing the algorithm on 100 mock catalogs shows that, on average, the membership of the identified clusters is \$(91.5\textbackslash pm 3.5)\$\textbackslash\% complete and the fraction of unrelated stars is \$(10.4\textbackslash pm 2.0)\$\textbackslash\%. We apply the algorithm to the stars in the field of view of the Perseus double cluster from the Data Release 2 of Gaia. This approach identifies a single structure, Sub1, that separates into two substructures, Sub1-1 and Sub1-2. These substructures coincide with \$h\$ Per and \$\textbackslash chi\$ Per: the distributions of the proper motions and the color-magnitude diagrams of the members of Sub1-1 and Sub1-2 are fully consistent with those of \$h\$ Per and \$\textbackslash chi\$ Per reported in the literature. These results suggest that our hierarchical clustering algorithm can be a powerful tool to unveil the complex kinematic information of star clusters.},

By smoothing the star distribution through a Gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional (3D) density maps for early-type stars (upper-main sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a 3D, G-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower-mass star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map due to the lack of large numbers of bright, early-type stars. We report the finding of a candidate new open cluster towards l, b {$\sim$} 218.5\textdegree{} , - 2\textdegree, which could be related to the Orion star-forming complex. We estimate ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous. Finally, we find that the 3D density maps show no evidence for the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt. {$<$}P /{$>$}The PMS and UMS catalogues are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{$<$}/A{$>$} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/620/A172"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/620/A172{$<$}/A{$>$}},

Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large datasets and minimization of I/O costs.This paper presents a data clustering method named BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is especially suitable for very large databases. BIRCH incrementally and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the available resources (i.e., available memory and time constraints). BIRCH can typically find a good clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few additional scans. BIRCH is also the first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle "noise" (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.We evaluate BIRCH's time/space efficiency, data input order sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments. We also present a performance comparisons of BIRCH versus CLARANS, a clustering method proposed recently for large datasets, and show that BIRCH is consistently superior.},

The metallicity gradient of open clusters and its outliers provide an effective way to probe for this process. In this work, we compile metallicity, age, and kinematic parameters for 225 open clusters and carry out a quantitative analysis of radial migration via the calculated migration distances. Based on clusters with age \${$<$} 0.5\$ Gyr, we obtain the present-day metallicity gradient of \$-0.074 \textbackslash pm 0.007\$ dex/kpc. Along this gradient distributes three sequences, and clusters in the upper, the middle, and the lower groups are found to be old outward-migrators, in-situ clusters, and inward-migrators, respectively. The migration distance increases with age, but its most effective time is probably less than 3 Gyr. The metallicity gradient breaks out at \$R\_g\$ (guiding center radius) \$\textbackslash sim11.5\$ kpc, which is caused by the lack of young open clusters in the outer disk and the presence of old outward-migrators in the upper sequence. It shows that this boundary is related to the different effects of radial migration between the inner and outer disks. We also found many special open clusters in and near the outer disk of \$R {$>$} 11\$ kpc and a steeper metallicity gradient from the inner disk of \$R\_g {$<$} 7\$ kpc, which tells a complicated evolution history of the Galactic disk by different effects of stellar radial migration.},

Using cluster members identified with these astrometry and photometry in Gaia DR2, we can obtain a reliable determination of cluster properties. However, because of the shortcoming of Gaia spectroscopic observation in dealing with densely crowded cluster region, the number of radial velocity and metallicity for cluster member stars from Gaia DR2 is still lacking. In this study, we aim to improve the cluster properties by combining the LAMOST spectra. In particular, we provide the list of cluster members with spectroscopic parameters as an add-value catalog in LAMOST DR5, which can be used to perform detailed study for a better understanding on the stellar properties, by using their spectra and fundamental properties from the host cluster. We cross-matched the spectroscopic catalog in LAMOST DR5 with the identified cluster members in Cantat-Gaudin et al.2018 and then used members with spectroscopic parameters to derive statistical properties of open clusters. We obtained a list of 8811 members with spectroscopic parameters and a catalog of 295 cluster properties. In addition, we study the radial and vertical metallicity gradient and age-metallicity relation with the compiled open clusters as tracers, finding slopes of -0.053\$\textbackslash pm\$0.004 dex kpc\$\^\{-1\}\$, -0.252\$\textbackslash pm\$0.039 dex kpc\$\^\{-1\}\$ and 0.022\$\textbackslash pm\$0.008 dex Gyr\$\^\{-1\}\$, respectively. Both slopes of metallicity distribution relation for young clusters (0.1 Gyr {$<$} Age {$<$} 2 Gyr) and the age-metallicity relation for clusters within 6 Gyr are consistent with literature results.

  abstract = {Recent analyses of Gaia data have resulted in the identification of new stellar structures, including a new class of extended stellar filaments called stellar "strings," first proposed by Kounkel \& Covey. We explore the spatial, kinematic, and chemical composition of strings to demonstrate that these newfound structures are largely inconsistent with being physical objects whose members share a common origin. Examining the 3D spatial distribution of string members, we find that the spatial dispersion around the claimed string spine does not improve in the latest Gaia DR3 data release-despite tangible gains in the signal-to-noise ratio of the parallax measurements-counter to expectations of a bona fide structure. Using the radial velocity dispersion of the strings (averaging \$\{\textbackslash sigma \}\_\{\{V\}\_\{r\}\}=16\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{km\}\textbackslash,\{\{\textbackslash rm\{s\}\}\}\^\{-1\}\$ ) to estimate their virial masses, we find that all strings are gravitationally unbound. Given the finding that the strings are dispersing, the reported stellar ages of the strings are typically 120\texttimes{} larger than their measured dispersal times. Finally, we validate prior work that stellar strings are more chemically homogeneous than their local field stars but show it is possible to obtain the same signatures of chemical homogeneity by drawing random samples of stars from spatially, temporally, and kinematically unrelated open clusters. Our results show that while some strings may be composed of real substructures, there is no consistent evidence for larger string-like connections over the sample. These results underscore the need for caution in over-interpreting the significance of these strings and their role in understanding the star formation history of the Milky Way.},
